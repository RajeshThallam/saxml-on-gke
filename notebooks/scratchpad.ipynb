You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson\\'s Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson\\'s are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson\\'s disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson\\'s often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson\\'s disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson\\'s can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\\n\\nSummary: [/INST]',\n",

However, another NVA force arrives and an all out battle commences. During the battle, two of the men are killed, but the team kills off all of the NVA reinforcements and captures their leader. The team is next sent on another mission to capture two village women, and then another to destroy an enemy base where another member is killed. They kill all of the NVA forces in the base, but their mission gets tougher when a prisoner escapes and captures American women and holds them hostage. The NVA splits up into two forces: one at an old fort and the other to ambush the team as it arrives. Despite the NVA plan of ambush, the NVA are wiped out, but they manage to kill two of the women and one of the special squad. Realizing that there is little time, the squad goes on with their mission and finds the fort. Their squad leader goes inside the fort to recon and is captured.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there. The Macfadden School ran from 1939 to 1950 at the William Kingsland mansion in the village.\\nAnswer: [/INST]\",\n",
       " '<s>[INST] Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose biography was Michael Kennedy?  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer\\'s wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\\nThe answer is: [/INST]',\n",

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D. Because the role had to be changed for the new actress\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - William Walton `` Bill \\'\\' Sharman ( May 25 , 1926 -- October 25 , 2013 ) was an American professional basketball player and coach . He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s , partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time . As a coach , Sharman won titles in the ABL , ABA , and NBA , and is credited with introducing the morning shootaround . He was a 10 - time NBA Champion ( having won four titles as a player with the Celtics , one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , and five as a Lakers executive ) , and a 12 - time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles . Sharman is also a two - time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been being inducted in 1976 as a player , and in 2004 as a coach . Only John Wooden , Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor .  - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston. It is named after its sponsor, TD Bank, a subsidiary of Canada\\'s Toronto-Dominion Bank.  - Robert Joseph \"Bob\" Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 196970 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons.   - The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)\\'s Boston Bruins. The franchise\\'s 17 championships are the most of any NBA franchise, and account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league\\'s founding in 1946. As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team\\'s offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach\\'s game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer).  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration\\'s ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America\\'s roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation\\'s air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \"This will not only create jobs immediately. It\\'s also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \\n\\nBased on the paragraph, does the response \"More jobs, better commute times\" correctly answer the question \"What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\"?

The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke\\'s call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

Inhabited on a mysterious island are strange creatures called Boggs who love meat. Unbeknownst to them, it is also inhabited by a shipwrecked boy. He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun. On the first night they see the Polar Star and Lord Rogers says that sailors always used this star to guide the way back home.\\nA: [/INST]\",\n",

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco?\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let\\'s say you\\'re working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I\\'m worried you aren\\'t going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\\n\\nWhat is a summary? [/INST]',\n",

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.\\nA: [/INST]\",\n",

Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \"mass of information\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence\\'s occupation of Aqaba covering the \"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\"\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nWhat is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\\nYou could go directly into the confessional (provided there\\'s no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it\\'s nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord\\'s kingdom and how you\\'re a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you\\'ve been responding to God\\'s call and how you\\'ve been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You\\'ll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it\\'s totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won\\'t treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that\\'s fine, too. The priest knows what he\\'s doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you\\'ve made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest\\'s lead. He\\'ll ask you how long it\\'s been since your last confession (if you don\\'t voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It\\'s just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you\\'re more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you\\'re talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don\\'t remember the exact timeframe, that\\'s fine. If you don\\'t remember your motivation, that\\'s fine. All your priest cares about is that you\\'re being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He\\'ll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He\\'s there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don\\'t worry! It won\\'t be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It\\'ll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \"absolution\" means your sins are washed away. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you\\'re truly sorry for what you\\'ve done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.\\n\\nSummary: [/INST]',\n",

Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. Question: The writer tries to  _  in this passage.

Although he is classified as an Expressionist artist, he rejected both the term and the movement. In the 1920s, he was associated with the New Objectivity (\"Neue Sachlichkeit\"), an outgrowth of Expressionism that opposed its introverted emotionalism.  - Alexander Kanoldt ( 29 September 1881 -- 24 January 1939 ) was a German magic realist painter and one of the artists of the New Objectivity . Kanoldt was born in Karlsruhe . His father was the painter Edmond Kanoldt , a late practitioner of the Nazarene style . After studies at the Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe in Karlsruhe he went to Munich in 1908 , where he met a number of modernists such as Alexei Jawlensky , Wassily Kandinsky and Gabriele Münter . He became a member of the Munich New Secession in 1913 , with Jawlensky and Paul Klee . After military service in World War I from 1914 to 1918 , the still lifes Kanoldt painted show the influence of Derain and an adaptation of cubist ideas . By the early 1920s Kanoldt developed the manner for which he is best known , a magic realist rendering of potted plants , angular tins , fruit and mugs on tabletops . He also painted portraits in the same severe style , as well as geometrical landscapes . In 1925 he was made a professor at Breslau Academy , a post he held until 1931 . During this time he came into conflict with the Bauhaus faction at the Academy , and he was increasingly at odds with the avant garde . From 1933 until his resignation in 1936 he was the director of the State School of Art in Berlin . With the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933 Kanoldt attempted accommodation , painting in a romantic style , but nonetheless many of his works were seized by the authorities as degenerate art in 1937 . He died in Berlin in 1939 .  - George Grosz (July 26, 1893  July 6, 1959) was a German artist known especially for his caricatural drawings and paintings of Berlin life in the 1920s. He was a prominent member of the Berlin Dada and New Objectivity group during the Weimar Republic. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, and became a naturalized citizen in 1938. Abandoning the style and subject matter of his earlier work, he exhibited regularly and taught for many years at the Art Students League of New York. In 1956 he returned to Berlin where he died.  - The New Objectivity (in ) was a movement in German art that arose during the 1920s as a reaction against expressionism. The term was coined by Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub, the director of the in Mannheim, who used it as the title of an art exhibition staged in 1925 to showcase artists who were working in a post-expressionist spirit.  As these artistswho included Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, and George Groszrejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the expressionists, Weimar intellectuals in general made a call to arms for public collaboration, engagement, and rejection of romantic idealism.    \\'alexander kanoldt\\' is related to which object entity through the relation of \\'movement\\'?

One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film.

They are the body’s attempt to ‘wall off’ an infection and keep it from spreading. Abscesses can form either after a bite from another guinea pig, or if something rough and sharp (e.g., straw) goes through the skin. They can form anywhere on a guinea pig’s body, but the most common locations are the head and neck.  An abscess in the neck could be a swelling of the lymph node in that area. Lymph nodes are small glands that help the body fight infection. An abscess can feel firm or soft. Abscesses can also form in the mouth or jaw of a guinea pig. Abscesses in these areas can become large very quickly. Your guinea pig may look fine on one day, then have a large abscess the next day. When you handle your guinea pig, gently open its mouth to see the abscess. If the abscess is in the jaw, you will see a large bump along your guinea pig’s jawline. Guinea pigs can get several types of cysts, with the most common being a sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cysts contain oil from the skin glands that produce oil (sebaceous glands). Sebaceous cysts are typically located on a guinea pig’s back and near the rump, but can form in other places as well. Although they can become very large, cysts are usually about the size of a pea. Cysts become a problem if they become large. Tumors can also form lumps. For example, a lump on your guinea pig’s tail could indicate a skin tumor called trichofolliculoma.  A lump on the chest could indicate another type of cancer called lymphosarcoma.  A female guinea pig can develop a mammary tumor, which you would see as a lump on the belly.  Lipomas are tumors made up of fat cells. There are no specific places where you would look for a lipoma on your guinea pig. Your guinea pig may have several lipomas at one time. Sometimes, a lump can make a guinea pig feel so bad that it doesn’t want to eat. For example, if your guinea pig is not eating its meals and doesn’t want any tasty treats, check its mouth for an abscess. Even if your guinea pig wants to eat, the size of the abscess in its mouth or jaw could make it difficult to chew food. Sometimes, a guinea pig will stop eating right before an abscess ruptures (an abscess can sometimes rupture on its own). When you hold your guinea pig, take a quick sniff of its breath. If your guinea pig has a mouth abscess, its breath will probably smell quite unpleasant. The unpleasant smell would be due to infection. Along with bad breath, you may also notice drooling. An abscess can be very uncomfortable for a guinea pig. If your guinea pig squeals with pain when you pick it up, seems really tired, or doesn’t want to play with you, it could have an abscess. You may also notice your guinea pig heavily grooming the area of the abscess.\\n\\nWhat is a summary? [/INST]',\n",

There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one\\'s mind. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one\\'s mind. According to the Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the Jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The \"Tathāgatagarbha Sutras\" are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature.

Five men, criminals Ray, Dave, Stevie, Julian (\"Julie\" as a nickname), and Jason, plan a heist to steal a minimum of £2 million. Using a truck modified as a battering ram, the group break into a security depot in London and steal a large amount of money before the police arrive. However, they discover they barely got the amount of money they wanted, and only £68,000 to each man. Julian demands an extra amount of money as \"expenses\" for his work, but is beaten and placed in the boot of Ray\\'s car until he just accepts his share. The group, without Julian, later spend time at a bar with fellow criminal Sonny, and Ray\\'s girlfriend Connie, a protester. Ray and Stevie also visit an elderly couple, Linda and Bill, where they leave their stolen money for safekeeping. The next day, Ray and Stevie, who live together with Connie, are alerted by a bruised Dave that his money was stolen, apparently by Julian. Ray, Dave and Stevie investigate Linda and Bill\\'s home to find them murdered and the money stolen, leaving Ray emotionally distraught. He visits Julian but his money is missing too. They conclude that Sonny stole the money and break into his house, only to find Jason dead with a headwound. The four are alerted to a pair of undercover police officers and flee, Dave and Julian engaging in a shootout with the police. Believing that he may be arrested for murder, Ray decides to flee after the money is found, and goes to his mother and Connie for help. His mother gives him some money and her car to use, disappointed in her son\\'s career but still caring for him. Ray then speaks with Connie and asks her to come with him, and to meet her at a roadside service station on the M1 if she decides to come.\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

He and his sister, Letty (b. 1943), were raised in Midwood, Brooklyn. He is the son of Nettie (nee Cherry; November 8, 1906 - January 27, 2002), a bookkeeper at her family\\'s delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (December 25, 1900 - January 8, 2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His family was Jewish, and his grandparents immigrated to the US from Russia and Austria and spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, and German.\\n\\nIn 1966, Allen wrote the play Don\\'t Drink the Water. The play starred Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette and Allen\\'s future movie co-star Tony Roberts. A film adaptation of the play, directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring Jackie Gleason. Because he was not particularly happy with the 1969 film version of his play, in 1994, Allen directed and starred in a second version for television, with Michael J. Fox and Mayim Bialik.  The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was Play It Again, Sam, in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured Diane Keaton and Roberts. The play was significant to Keaton\\'s budding career, and she has stated she was in \"awe\" of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him. During an interview in 2013, Keaton stated that she \"fell in love with him right away,\" adding, \"I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it.\" After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent film version of Play It Again, Sam, she would later co-star in Sleeper, Love and Death, Interiors, Manhattan and Annie Hall. \"He showed me the ropes and I followed his lead. He is the most disciplined person I know. He works very hard,\" Keaton has stated. \"I find the same thing sexy in a man now as I always have: humor. I love it when they are funny. It\\'s to die for.\"  For its March 21, 1969, issue, Life featured Allen on its cover. In 1981, his play The Floating Light Bulb premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances. While receiving mixed reviews, it gave an autobiographical insight into Allen\\'s childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. He has written several one-act plays, including Riverside Drive and Old Saybrook exploring well-known Allen themes.  On October 20, 2011, Allen\\'s one-act play Honeymoon Motel opened as part of a larger piece entitled Relatively Speaking on Broadway, with two other one-act plays, one by Ethan Coen and one by Elaine May.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he write anything else?

His father Tom (Van Quattro) reprimands him for being up so late and opening the door, sending him off to bed. Instead Derek watches from the stairs as his curious father opens the gift. Finding a musical orb shaped like Santa Claus in the box he activates it, causing it to strangle him with retractable cords; as Tom struggles he slips and falls onto a fireplace poker, his impaled body being found by his wife Sarah (Jane Higginson) a few moments later.Two weeks later, Sarah takes Derek, who hasn\\'t spoken since his father\\'s death, to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto (Mickey Rooney) and his odd son Pino (Brian Bremer) not realizing they have been followed by Noah Adams (Tracy Fraim). After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, belittling him and blaming him for all the store\\'s recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold (Gerry Black).

The mistakes include: Think they pick the wrong major   A student should explore any possibility that interests him, and future careers might just be around the corner. Remember, if you don't know what to do, it's OK! Think their teachers know everything Students may think of their teachers as gods who know everything, but that really is not the case.

Born and raised in New York, Lohan was signed to Ford Models as a child. Having appeared as a regular on Another World at age 10, her breakthrough came in Disney Pictures\\' The Parent Trap (1998).\\n\\nIn July 2007, Lohan\\'s home was burgled by the Bling Ring, a group of fashion-motivated burglars whose ringleader considered Lohan to be their ultimate conquest. Video surveillance of the burglary recorded at Lohan\\'s home played a large role in breaking the case.  During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Lohan offered her services to Barack Obama\\'s Democratic election effort, but was declined. In a blog post, Lohan criticized the media and then Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin for not focusing on policy, and attacked Palin\\'s positions on homosexuality, birth control and abortion. Lohan had previously expressed an interest in going to Iraq, during the Iraq War in 2006, on a USO tour with Hillary Clinton. In the 2012 presidential election, Lohan supported Republican candidate Mitt Romney, something that prompted ABC News to call her a \"political turncoat\". Only weeks later, she tweeted words supportive of Obama.  Speaking about her sexual orientation, Lohan said that she was not a lesbian. When asked if she was bisexual in 2008, she responded \"Maybe. Yeah,\" adding, \"I don\\'t want to classify myself.\" However, in a 2013 interview, she said, \"I know I\\'m straight. I have made out with girls before, and I had a relationship with a girl. ... I think I was looking for something different.\"  In April 2016, Lohan was studying Islam and considered converting.  In October 2017, Lohan received scrutiny for defending Harvey Weinstein, whom she worked with on several films, on Instagram and saying that his wife Georgina Chapman should stay with him. Weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What are some controversys Lohan has been involved with?

Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \"chaos reigns.\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâ\\x80\\x99s thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots.

When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles   of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Options: A: Wave energy comes from the water.

As the entity responsible for the branding of the business, a corporate office may be much more responsive to consumer complaints.  Do an internet search on the business and look for their corporate contact information. Send an email or a letter to the appropriate person. Make sure to be polite and clearly articulate the problem or issue. Call the corporate entity and ask for customer service or the customer complaint department. Be polite and clearly explain the problem. Say something like “Hello, I was a guest at your location in Boston’s Back Bay. I was extremely disappointed with the service and cleanliness offered there. I feel taken advantage of.” If you booked the hotel through a travel or booking website, you may be able to complain directly to that business.  Be prepared to be put on hold for potentially long periods of time when contacting booking website customer service. Clearly articulate your complaint. Have your transaction number or receipt at hand. Be able to provide evidence, such as photographs, police reports, or the names of customer service representatives at the hotel. Be aware that hotel or travel booking websites are very often unresponsive to customer complaints. This owes to their high volume and slim margins on individual transactions. If the booking business is unable to resolve your complaint, your last recourse is to post a negative review about the hotel in question on their website. Depending on your complaint, you should consider contacting the relevant regulatory body. As government agencies that oversee businesses that offer public accommodations, they’ll be able to deal with and issue appropriate sanctions.  If you’re complaining about a health and sanitation issue, contact the local health department. Consider contacting the state or province’s division or department of hotels and restaurants.

In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\" He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin\\'s music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.\"  Answer:\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area\\'s plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place.\\nWhat changes happened when herbivores were eliminated in Yellowstone?

Plot title: Titanic Movie plot: At the last minute, a wealthy American expatriate in Europe, Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb), buys a steerage-class ticket for the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic from a Basque immigrant. Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (based on a real-life Titanic survivor Molly Brown), Maude Young (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \"Giff\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S. Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism. When Annette learns her mother\\'s intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with her father on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that her daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his child, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. Richard joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play contract bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds Richard about a shuffleboard game they had scheduled, Richard coldly brushes him off. Meanwhile Giff falls for Annette at first glance. At first she repulses his brash attempts to become better acquainted, but eventually she warms to him. That night, Giff, Annette and a group of young people sing and play the piano in the dining...

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Halmstad Municipality (\"Halmstads kommun\") is a municipality in Halland County on the Swedish west coast, in which the city Halmstad is the seat.  - Timber framing and \"post-and-beam\" construction are methods of building with heavy timbers rather than dimensional lumber such as 2x4s. Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland\\'s population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Halmstad is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of Nissan in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast. Halmstad is the seat of Halmstad Municipality and the capital of Halland County. The city had a population of 92,797 in 2012, out of a municipal total of over 90,000 (18th most populous - 2012). Halmstad is Sweden\\'s 20th-largest city by population and located about midway between Gothenburg (the second most populous) and Malmö (the third). It is Europe\\'s northernmost city with a lot of timber framing architecture.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7\\xa0million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Halmstad Arena is a sports area in Halmstad , Sweden .

Movie title: Hondo Movie plot: The story takes place at some point between 1869 and 1877 (It is mentioned in the dialogue that Ulysses S. Grant is President). At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \"Hondo\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva.

If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: The Cooler Context: Unlucky Bernie Lootz (William H. Macy) has little positive going for him: he lives in a dreary place--a studio apartment in a run-down motel near the Las Vegas Strip; he can\\'t recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman; he\\'s indebted to the Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin), who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz\\' casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck \"cooler\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario (Maria Bello) seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luckÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94 and that of those around himÂ\\xa0â\\x80\\x94 takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn\\'t know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn\\'t know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri La. Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates, such as gangster Nicky Fingers, the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves.\\nA: [/INST]',\n",

Two men named Ty and Vachel are hunting in a forest and come across an abandoned church, which they go in to explore. After Ty sees their truck being crashed into a tree, Vachel is stabbed with a serrated machete by a chuckling assailant who then dons Vachel\\'s hat and jacket. Ty, seeing the murderer come out of the church, quietly flees off into the forest. Meanwhile, forest ranger Roy McLean is at his home, where he encounters a van of five college-aged adults heading to rural property which one of them has inherited. Despite his insistence that they not venture up the mountain, the five continue along. Among them are Warren; his girlfriend Constance; Jonathan, and his girlfriend, Megan; and Daniel, Jonathan\\'s brother. On their way up the mountain, they hit a deer, and encounter Ty stumbling through the woods on his way down the mountain; they dismiss his warnings of \"demons,\" as he is visibly drunk. After reaching a point where the van cannot drive any further, the group set out on foot and make a campsite; at night, while around the fire, Constance, Megan, and Daniel hear noises around them and become frightened, only to find that Jonathan and Warren are playing a joke on them. The next morning, they hike along Silver Creek to a waterfall, where they see a young girl named Merry Cat Logan singing before noticing their presence and running into the woods. Megan and Jonathan go skinny dipping at the bottom of the falls, unaware that someone else has entered the water. Megan feels hands touching her and assumes it\\'s Jonathan, until she sees him on shore, whereupon she panics and swims to safety.\\nA: [/INST]',\n",

When you read, you can not only learn some new words, but also learn how to use these English words. When you read, it gives you a good example for writing. Good reading tips: Try to read at the right level  . Read something that you can (more or less) understand. If you need to stop every three words to use a dictionary, it is not interesting. Try to increase   the number of your new words. If there are four or five new words on a page, write them in your notebook. But you don't have to write them while you read. Instead, try to guess their meanings as you read: mark   them with a pen. Then come back when you have finished reading to look them up in a dictionary and write them in your own vocabulary   book. Then try to remember them. Try to read regularly. For example, read for a short time once a day. Fifteen minutes every day is better than two hours every Sunday. Fix   a time to read and keep to it. You could read for fifteen minutes when you go to bed, or when you get up or at lunchtime. Read what interests you. Choose a book or a magazine about a subject that you like, because you are going to spend time and money reading it. So, choose an interesting book. You can also read newspapers. There are many English newspapers in China. For example, 21st Century Teens. It is easy enough for you to understand. There is something interesting in it.\\nAnswer: [/INST]\",\n",

Your task is to \"decompose the question\"i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don\\'t add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question\\'s answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.\\nProblem:Question: Do sun bears stay active during winter?, Answer:Yes, Description of Sun bear: bear found in tropical forest habitats of Southeast Asia, Fact1: The sun bear is a species in the family Ursidae occurring in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia., Fact2:  Sun bears do not seem to hibernate., Fact3: Hibernation is a seasonal heterothermy characterized by low body-temperature, slow breathing and heart-rate, and low metabolic rate.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city\\'s political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.\"?\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

We arrived at 10:45 am and were told that we could not use the Groupon and they would only honor it until 10:30 am.  We asked if we could apply it to lunch and we got a firm no.  They said it was Groupon's fault because it was supposed to state breakfast and they printed brunch.  That isn't our fault.  We went somewhere else for a late breakfast and happily gave them our money.  It is tacky and defeating to turn customers away.  We will never go back and we will be sure to tell everyone we know about this.   By putting things on Groupon you stand a good chance of aquiring new and loyal customers.  Turning people away is not a great way to build a customer base. [/INST]\",\n",

But for the first Navy SEALs that would have been something of a luxury as they landed on beaches in the dark on two-man motorised rafts dubbed 'flying mattresses'. Often members were only armed with knives and wore nothing but swimming trunks and flippers as they carried out seaborne clandestine missions during the Second World War. Scroll down for video. Two combat swimmers from the Maritime Unit of the Office of Strategic Services can been seen during a training exercise in 1944, where they are on one of the raft's dubbed a 'flying mattress' in just their trunks. Frank Monteleone, 89, was a member of an elite commando force within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) - the precursor to the CIA. Created after the United States entered Second World War, the OSS pioneered many of the intelligence-gathering techniques and commando-style tactics used by today's U.S. Special Forces. The spy agency's Maritime Unit, formed in 1943, shares the credit for setting the foundation for what would become the Navy SEALs, created during the Kennedy administration in 1962. Head of the OSS, William 'Wild Bill' Donovan - a Wall Street lawyer - recruited yachtsmen, Olympic-calibre swimmers and California's 'beach rats' - lifeguards and surfers. The son of Italian immigrants, Mr Monteleone was recruited by the OSS because he spoke fluent Italian and was trained as a Navy radio operator. He said he went through 'all kinds of training' with the services, including demolition and hand-to-hand combat, but had missed out on parachute training - a must for any OSS operator. Frank Monteleone, 89, was a member of an elite commando force within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Once in the Mediterranean Theatre of operations, his detachment was assigned to the British Eighth Army. Mr Monteleone, now a retired tailor living in Staten Island, New York, said: 'When they sent me to the British, they wanted to know if I had jump training. I said no, and they gave it to me right then and there.' He explained how he conducted dangerous missions nearly the entire length of Italy, from the beaches at Anzio to the Alps, often working with Italian partisans behind the lines. Some of the missions entailed landing on beaches at night using the inflated craft that resembled mattresses and were powered by silent electrical motors. Mr Monteleone and his Italian comrades named the teardrop-shaped vessel 'tartuga,' which is Italian for turtle. Combat swimmer Lt. John Booth is seen wearing a rebreather, a precursor to SCUBA during a training exercise and features in new book, 'First SEALs: The Untold Story of the Forging of America's Most Elite Unit' Members of the combat swimmers and other operatives conduct an operation in the South Pacific in 1945 \\xa0to provide reconnaissance and demolition missions that allowed the Navy to land on key islands during the war. His story along with others is told in a new book entitled 'First SEALS: The Untold Story of the Forging of America's Most Elite Unit' and reveals what it was like to be a member of the early commando force. Its release comes as a member of the SEAL team that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 chose to waive his anonymity and went public with his role in taking down the terrorist leader in Pakistan. Frank Monteleone, centre, pictured with other members of the Maritime Unit, attached to the British Eighth Army. Rob O'Neill, a highly-decorated veteran who quit after 16 years service, has chosen to given an interview to Fox News - due to be broadcast later this month. O'Neill claims to be 'The Shooter' and said he shot him three times 'just for luck'. The book's author, Patrick K. O'Donnell said he had always wanted to write a book on the early Navy SEALs. 'The bin Laden raid was sort of the culmination of what all these men had built from 1943 to 1945,' he said. O'Donnell, who has written eight previous books on Second World War military and intelligence history, had met Mr Monteleone 15 years ago while researching a book on the OSS. Speaking of Mr Monteleone's role in the war, he said: 'The radio operator was the key to the mission. If you could not send and receive information on missions behind the lines, you were dead.' Approximately 13,000 people served in the OSS during the war, but only a few hundred were in the Maritime Unit and O'Donnell believes Mr Monteleone may be one of the last still living. Another member included in the book is Gordon Soltau, a combat swimmer considered one of the Navy's first 'frogmen.' Mr Soltau, who starred for the San Francisco 49ers during the 1950s, died in California at 89 on October 26, just days before the new book was published. Rob O'Neill (left) has waived his right to anonymity and claims to be 'The Shooter' that killed al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden in a raid on his compound in Pakistan (right) in 2011.

It was released in August 2008 as the fourth single release of his career, and the lead single from his album \"Easy Does It\".

Owen had previously recorded the song on his 2006 debut album \"Startin\\' with Me\". Owen wrote this song with Eric Durrance.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \"country music\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \"hillbilly music\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \"country music\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - `` Something About a Woman \\'\\' is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen . It was released in August 2007 as the third and final single from his debut CD Startin \\' with Me .

This album produced three singles, all of which reached top 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart: his debut single \"Yee Haw,\" \"Startin\\' with Me,\" and \"Something About a Woman.\" A second studio album, 2009\\'s \"Easy Does It,\" has accounted for three more singles: \"Don\\'t Think I Can\\'t Love You,\" \"Eight Second Ride,\" and \"Tell Me.\" In September 2011, Owen achieved his first number one hit on the country charts with the title track to his third studio album \"Barefoot Blue Jean Night,\" as did with \"Alone with You,\" \"The One That Got Away,\" and \"Anywhere with You.\" His fourth studio album, \"Days of Gold\" produced two singles with its title track, which broke the top 20 in 2014, and the number one single \"Beachin\\'.\"  - Startin\\' with Me is the debut album of country music artist Jake Owen, released in July 2006 (see 2006 in country music) on RCA Records Nashville. Singles released from the album include \"Yee Haw\", the title track, and \"Something About a Woman\", all of which have charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts. \"Yee Haw\", the first of these three, reached number 16, \"Startin\\' with Me\" was the highest-peaking, at number 6, and \"Something About a Woman\" peaked at number 15.  - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is one of SME\\'s flagship record labels alongside sister labels Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country.

Then the old man was ready to close the door and said, \"No, boy, I don\\'t need any magazine of any kind, now goodbye.\" The little boy was sad that he was not going to make his quota with the sale. He was also sad for the old man being so alone in the big house. The boy went home and then had an idea. He knocked on the door again and this time the old man came right to the door. \"Boy, I thought I told you no magazines.\" \"No, sir. But I want to give you a gift. The boy handed him the figurine and the man\\'s face lit up. \"It\\'s a Golden Retriever, and I have one at home, this is for you. The old man was simply stunned ; no one had ever given him such a gift and shown him so much kindness. From that day on, the old man started coming out of the house and _ people. He and the boy became friends; the boy even brought his dog to see the man weekly. Options: A The boy felt sorry only because he was not going to make his quota with the sale. B The old man regarded all the collectibles as his family. C Few people went to the old man\\'s house. D The boy went to the old man\\'s house twice.

He is perhaps best known for developing Self - Discrepancy Theory .  - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context. The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term \"Ivy League\" has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.  - George II (George Augustus 30 October / 9 November 1683\\xa0 25 October 1760) was King of Great Britain and Ireland, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 11 June 1727 (O.S.) until his death.  - Higher Learning is a 1995 American drama film written and directed by John Singleton, and starring an ensemble cast. The film follows the changing lives of three incoming freshmen at the fictional Columbus University: Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a black track star who struggles with academics; Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson), a shy and naive girl; and Remy (Michael Rapaport), a lonely and confused man seemingly out of place in his new environment.  - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.  - Columbia University (officially Columbia University in the City of New York) is a private Ivy League research university in Upper Manhattan, New York City. It was established in 1754 as King\\'s College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain. Columbia is the oldest college in the state of New York and the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the country, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded before the Declaration of Independence. After the American Revolutionary War, King\\'s College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. A 1787 charter placed the institution under a private board of trustees before it was renamed Columbia University in 1896 when the campus was moved from Madison Avenue to its current location in Morningside Heights occupying of land. Columbia is one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities, and was the first school in the United States to grant the M.D. degree.  - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.

It\\'s absolutely laughable for a liberal governor of Massachusetts to suggest that I am not conservative -- the man that provided the template for Obamacare, the man who supported the Wall Street bailouts,\" Santorum said Saturday.\\n\\nWhile assailing the wealthiest candidate in the race for his support of Wall Street, Santorum also continued to test a new line of attack, suggesting Romney\\'s tax plan smacks of \"Occupy\" movement politics. Santorum complained about proposals to limit deductions and exemptions for wealthy earners.\\n\\n\"We have a Republican running for president who is campaigning as an Occupy Wall Street adherent. What\\'s he going to do? He\\'s going to limit charitable deductions on the top 1 percent,\" Santorum said.\\n\\nIt may be difficult for Santorum to make that charge stick. If anything, Romney has struggled to shed the image that he\\'s anything but the 1 percent -- having run into trouble a day earlier for casually noting how his wife drives \"a couple of Cadillacs.\"\\n\\nRomney, meanwhile, is targeting Santorum\\'s credibility.\\n\\nIn Lansing, Mich., on Saturday, he swiped at his opponent over his comment at the last debate that he only voted for No Child Left Behind because he had to \"take one for the team.\"\\n\\n\"Um -- the team has got to be the people of America,\" Romney said.\\n\\nHis campaign has also released web videos challenging the former Pennsylvania senator\\'s principles.\\n\\nRomney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho suggested the \"desperate and false attacks\" by Santorum were a response to recent poll figures.\\n\\n\"This sounds like another case of Rick Santorum abandoning his principles for his own political advantage,\" she said in a statement.\\n\\nRecent polling shows Santorum holding onto the lead nationally, but losing the edge to Romney in Michigan.\\n\\nThe latest Rasmussen Reports poll showed Romney leading Santorum in the state 40-34 percent. Santorum had been ahead in most Michigan polls for the past couple weeks.\\n\\nArizona, where Romney has held the consistent lead in polling, also holds its primary on Tuesday along with Michigan. But Michigan has emerged as a vital contest, and a veritable must-win state for Romney. It was the state where he was born, where his father was governor and where he won in the 2008 GOP presidential primary.\\n\\nRomney, along with his wife Ann, will be campaigning across the state on Saturday in the competition with Santorum for voters.\\n\\nThe other two candidates, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul, are far back in the polls in Tuesday\\'s contests and looking ahead to subsequent primaries and caucuses.\\n\\nGingrich told Fox News he expects to \"get some votes\" on Tuesday but acknowledged the frontrunner status held by Romney and Santorum.\\n\\n\"I think Santorum is discovering, in Michigan, where he was ahead a week ago, that when Romney goes negative and when he buys enough advertising, that he\\'s very formidable,\" Gingrich said.\\n\\nGingrich noted that he\\'s been campaigning in Washington state, which holds its caucuses shortly before the Super Tuesday primaries on March 6, when 10 states hold elections.\\n\\nPaul is holding a rally in Oklahoma on Saturday, before making his way to Michigan.\\n\\nEven if Santorum beats Romney, Romney will emerge with a healthy share of delegates to add to his lead in the count, never mind fundraising and campaign organization in a race that was designed to carry into the spring.\\n\\nAnd there is the chance for a split decision if Romney wins the popular vote but Santorum emerges with more delegates. Most of the state\\'s 30 delegates are awarded two at a time to the winner in each of the state\\'s 14 congressional districts.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. [/INST]',\n",

One day, while trying to make a living for his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby bog. He dropped his tools and ran to the bog. There, tapped to his waist in black mud, was a terrified boy, screaming and struggling to free himself. Farmer Fleming saved the boy from what could have been a slow and terrifying death. The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman\\' s surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved. \"I want to repay you,\" said the nobleman. \"You saved my son\\' s life.\" \"No, I can\\'  t accept payment for what I did,\" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer. At that moment, the farmer\\' s own son came to the door of the family hovel . \"Is that your son?\" the nobleman asked. \"Yes, \"the farmer replied proudly. \"I\\' ll make you a deal.

Context: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more. I chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I’ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.

An American study suggests that being surrounded by happy friends and neighbours could have more of an effect on your happiness than money.That is the finding of researchers from Harvard University and the University of California at San Diego.     Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler studied the emotional health of more than 4,700 people.They used information from the Framingham Heart Study.That study began sixty years ago in the American community of Framingham.Massachusetts.It was started to learn more about the risks of heart attack and stroke.          For the new study,the researchers examined the emotions of the men and women in the Framingham Heart Study.The information was gathered from 1983 to 2003.     The researchers found that friends of happy people had a greater chance of being happy themselves.That means that happiness spreads,or has a contagious effect,among people.And,the smaller the physical distance between friends,the larger the effect they had on each other's happiness.     Sadness was also contagious among friends,but not as much as happiness.The researchers say social groups did not influence happiness as much as personal situations.   However,people removed by as much as three degrees of separation still had an effect on one's  happiness.The expression three degrees of separation means the friends of an individual's  friends.     In fact,persons with three degrees of separation had a greater effect on an individual's   happiness than having five thousand dollars.The researchers say the study is historic because it shows that social effects on health can be spread among people.     Another finding is that people who work together or are married do not have as much of an effect on happiness levels as friends.The researchers say this is often true among friends of the same sex.\\n [/INST]\",\n",

When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants\\' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John\\'s Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England\\'s fortune in the Hundred Years\\' War against France. As a result of Henry\\'s victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Throughout the book, even the main character does not have a distinct age, physical appearance, or personality (unless you own the paperback copy with her on the cover). And although she does have the power of clairvoyance, most of the story is way too predictable.

Chomina brings his wife(Tantoo Cardinal), young son, and daughter, Annuka(Sandrine Holt), as well as several other men and their families. The group departs and heads up river, but turmoil soon engulfs the expedition. Several of the men fear Laforgue and believe he might be a demon, they employ a sorcerer, who verifies their fears. The group contemplate killing Laforgue, but settle on abandoning him. Daniel, who has grown to love Annuka during the journey, also abandons Laforgue. Laforgue resigns himself to die in the wilderness if it is Gods will. Chomina has a change of heart and returns with his family and Daniel to continue the journey with Laforgue. However, Iroquois discover them and kill Chominas wife before capturing the others. They brutally torture the group, killing Chominas son out-of-hand. Annuka sacrifices her dignity to free the group. They head upriver, but Chomina is now dying, due to wounds received in the encounter with the Iroqouis. Chomina wants to die peacefully, but Laforgue begs him to convert. He sends them on their way, still unbaptised. Annuka and Daniel take Laforgue still further, before leaving him within walking distance of the Huron settlement. When Laforgue enters the settlement, he finds the Hurons are decimated by scarlet fever. One of the missionaries has been killed and the other is dying.

Nor is there any information that radioactive materials have leaked outside due to the aftershock. \\n  \\n Higashidori\\'s only reactor was undergoing regular maintenance at the time of the temblor, and its fuel rods were not inside the core but were stored in a spent fuel pool, the agency said. \\n  \\n The Onagawa nuclear plant lost three of its four external power connections but one of them was restored on Friday morning, with its cooling system for the spent nuclear fuel pools temporarily stopped. \\n  \\n Tokyo Electric said no new abnormalities have developed in any of the six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi, which it has struggled to bring under control since the plant was crippled by the disaster and began spewing radioactive materials into the environment. \\n  \\n No workers at the plant were hurt in the aftershock, the power supplier said, adding that its damage control steps of pumping fresh water into the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors to prevent them from overheating and injecting nitrogen into the No. 1 unit to prevent hydrogen from exploding were unaffected. \\n  \\n The quake late Thursday, which was off Miyagi at a depth of about 66 kilometers, jolted areas in the prefecture already hit hard by last month\\'s quake. \\n  \\n Meanwhile, Tokyo Electric continued to release relatively low-level radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean to make room for far more contaminated water that has flooded the basement of the No. 2 reactor\\'s turbine building. \\n  \\n Once the utility finishes releasing the low contaminated water, it will check a facility that had held the water to see if there are any cracks to ensure that there would be no leakage when the more contaminated water is diverted there. \\n  \\n The turbine building needs to be cleared of radioactive water to restore sustainable cooling systems for the No. 2 reactor, which lost normal cooling functions and suffered a partial meltdown of the core since the deadly quake last month, along with the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors. \\n  \\n The No. 4 reactor had no fuel in its core but suffered a loss of cooling functions for its fuel pool. The No. 5 and No. 6 reactors have since been brought to a stable condition. \\n  \\n On Friday, the power company reinforced the earth around a cracked pit, from which highly radioactive water had leaked into the sea before it was successfully plugged by injecting sodium silicate, a chemical agent known as \\'\\'water glass.\\'\\' \\n  \\n Since the leakage had stopped, the company observed about a 7-centimeter rise in the level of contaminated water in a vertical tunnel connected to the No. 2 reactor building, from which the tainted water is believed to have originated. \\n  \\n ==Kyodo |||||\\nWhat is a shorter version of the above article?

       " '<s>[INST] Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who claims \"I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland\"?  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \"The Long and Winding Road\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \"stretching up into the hills\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles\\' history. McCartney recalled: \"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \"The Long and Winding Road\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones\\' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \"Without Love\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \"slightly jazzy\" and in keeping with Charles\\' style. The song\\'s home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \"It\\'s rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it\\'s a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

The crew finds hundreds of dead, shrivelled bat-like creatures and three naked humanoid bodies (two male and one female) in suspended animation within glass containers. The crew recovers the three aliens and begins the return trip to Earth. During the return journey, mission control loses contact with the shuttle and a rescue mission is launched to investigate. The rescuers discover that the Churchill has been severely damaged by fire, with its internal components destroyed, and the three containers bearing the aliens are all that remain intact. The aliens are taken to the European Space Research Centre in London where they are watched over by Dr. Leonard Bukovski (Gothard) and Dr. Hans Fallada (Finlay). Prior to an autopsy, the female alien (May) awakens and drains the \"life force\" out of a guard. The female alien then escapes the research facility and proceeds to drain various other humans of their life force, revealing an ability to shape-shift. It transpires that the aliens are from a race of space vampires that consume the life force of living beings, rather than their blood. Meanwhile, in Texas, an escape pod from the Churchill is found, with Colonel Tom Carlsen (Railsback) inside.

In a contest which was marred by a number of mystifying refereeing decisions, Burkina Faso survived the sending off of striker David Pitroipa and the ruling out of a seemingly legitimate strike to prevail on penalties. With the game ending 1-1 after extra-time, it was the Burkinabe which held its nerve to progress 3-2 on penalties and advance to Sunday\\'s showpiece final against Nigeria. \\'Super Eagles\\' end Ivory Coast\\'s AFCON hopes. The Super Eagles had earlier booked their place in the final with a convincing 4-1 win over Mali in Durban. Burkina Faso, which had not won a game away from home at the tournament before arriving in South Afirca, had endured a frustrating night with referee Jdidi Slim\\'s display a constant cause of consternation. But it will now have to take on Nigeria without star striker Jonathan Pitroipa, who was harshly shown a second yellow card for diving when it looked as if he had been fouled. Pitroipa\\'s 117th minute dismissal leaves the Burkinabe without its two star strikers following the injury to talented forward Alain Traore. Burkina Faso should have been given the chance to take an early lead when John Boye sent Pitroipa hurtling towards the turf inside the Ghana penalty area, but the referee wrongly waved away appeals for a spot kick. Instead, it was Ghana which was controversially awarded a penalty after the Jdidi adjudged that Christian Atsu had been fouled inside the penalty area. Mubarak Wakaso stood up to fire home from 12 yards and net his fourth goal of the competition. What can we expect from the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations? With both teams struggling to play on a terrible surface at the Mbombela Stadium, the game lacked any real sort of quality. But what it lacked in quality it more than made up for in drama and excitement as Burkina Faso continued to fight back against a perceived injustice. Ghana goalkeeper Fatawu Dauda produced a wonderful reaction save to deny Aristide Bance, while Asamoah Gyan hit a post for the Black Stars. But with an hour on the clock, the underdog finally got its reward as Bance was allowed time and space to fire home a deserved equalizer. Burkina Faso make giant strides. With the game moving into extra-time, Burkina Faso appeared to have scored a dramatic winner when Prejuce Nakoulma beat Dauda to the ball and prodded into the net. But most of those packed inside the stadium were left in disbelief when Jdidi ruled the goal out for a minor clash with Kwadwo Asamoah. Worse was to follow for the Burkinabe when Pitroipa was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for diving , despite replays showing he was quite clearly fouled. In the end, the contest went to penalties and it was Burkina Faso which held its nerve with Bakary Kone, Henri Traore and Bance all scoring to send it through to the final. Burkina captain Charles Kabore told reporters: \"The referee is human, all humans make mistakes, but he happened to make too many tonight. But we\\'re not going to dwell on that, we\\'ve qualified.\" \\'Super Eagles\\' end Ivory Coast\\'s AFCON hopes. In the day\\'s early kick off, Nigeria reached the final for the first time since 2000 following a comfortable victory over Mali. The Super Eages scored three times in 20 first half minutes to take control of the contest and leave manager Stephen Keshi dreaming of repeating the triumph he pulled off as a player in 1994. Elderson Echiejile headed Nigeria ahead on 25 minutes before Brown Ideye added a second on the half-hour mark. Momo Sissoko then deflected Emmanuel Emenike\\'s free-kick into the Mali net to leave his side facing an uphill struggle. And Ahmed Musa, who replaced the injured Victor Moses , inflicted further punishment on Mali when he ran through to score eight minutes after the interval. Mali, which famously came back from 4-0 down to draw 4-4 with Angola in the opening game of the 2010 finals, pulled one back through substitute Cheick Diarra in the 75th minute. Nigeria go through. But that failed to take the shine off for manager Keshi, who is now hoping to become only the second man in the tournament\\'s history to win the tournament as a player and a coach after Egypt\\'s Mahmoud El Gohary, who won it in 1959 and 1998. \"We won in 1994 after we had been together for five years,\" he told reporters. \"But we have been together for five weeks.

Context: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Article: In much society, there is often greater acceptance of light skin than dark skin; Light skin may be seen as a mark of beauty, intelligence and success. These beliefs can lead to social pressures even within the same group, if some members are darker than others. The result is that skin lightening has become very common across Africa, Asia and other areas of the world and more people with dark skin are using skin-lighting products, even if it means they may face health risks. They believe that having whiter skin will improve the quality of their lives. Many people think they will have a better family. Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful. Some beauty care  products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. However, some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural barrier  to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolored. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, which just makes things even worse. Doctor Ly says some chemicals are so dangerous that they may lead to blackened fingernails, infections  and serious skin damage. And these are not the only problems. Experts say some people who change their skin color suffer emotional damage. They feel regretful and sad. They feel that instead of risking their health, they should have learned to live and accept their skin color as it was. Question: What would be the best title for the passage? Answer:\\n\\n (i). Different Colors of Skin; (ii). The Dark Side of Skin Lightening; (iii). What Is Beauty?; (iv). Light Skin or Dark Skin?;\\nA: [/INST]',\n",

As always, it was a busy one, for \"Six days shall you labor and all your work\" was taken seriously back then. Outside, Father and Mr. Patrick next door were busy chopping firewood. Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string . It seemed there was  no limit to the heights to which kites would fly today. My mother looked at the sitting room, its furniture disordered for a thorough sweeping. Again she cast a look toward the window. \"Come on, girls! Let\\'s take string to the boys and watch them fly the kites a minute.\" On the way we met Mrs. Patric, laughing guiltily as if she were doing something wrong, together with her girls. There never was such a day for flying kites! We played all our fresh string into the boys\\' kites and they went up higher and higher. We could hardly distinguish the orange-colored spots of the kites. Now and then we slowly pulled one kite back, watching it dancing up and down in the wind, and finally bringing it down to earth, just for the joy of sending it up again.

Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king\\'s interests and those of his country and people\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \"vengeful and reckless\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander\\'s stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater\\'s hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian...\\nA: [/INST]',\n",

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven. Meanwhile, Alexia has told Marius, who is secretly her lover, that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and his Lycans attack that coven. Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic vampires, who are led by Vidar's daughter Lena.

Marius demands to know Eve's location, but Selene insists she does not know; Alexia confirms this after tasting blood from her sword. Marius sounds the retreat.

This is a great premise, but not as a whole book. I found myself completely uninterested in the few smatterings of story between their tales. I found myself sometimes even skipping to the next persons story due to sheer boredom.While this book suffers as a standalone, it really shines as a 500 page proloque to Fall of Hyperion. Under normal situations I would have stopped with this series but a family member said that I should read Fall, even if just to understand.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Researchers from the University of Stirling\\'s Behavioural Science Centre set out to explore claims that warm indoor temperatures have contributed to rising obesity levels in winter.Instead, the team found that people who live in well-heated homes are more likely to have low body mass index   levels while those who keep their heating turned down or off tend to be heavier. Dr Michael Daly, behavioral scientist and senior lecturer, said: \"We set out to investigate the scientific claims that cooler indoor temperatures help us maintain a healthy weight by pushing our bodies to use up more energy. In fact, the research suggests people may eat less and burn more energy when in a warmer indoor environment. The 13-year study, published in the journal Obesity, involved more than 100,000 adults across England. Researchers found reduced weight levels among people living in homes heated to above 23degC(73F), which involved about 15,000 of the households studied. Dr Daly said: \"As national gas bills continue to rise faster than the rate of inflation, this research suggests the obesity could worsen where heating is turned down below comfortable levels or off for long periods to cut costs.\" This is not just about people who live in well-heated homes being in the financial position to afford more expensive low-calorie foods, exercise classes and sporting activities, and therefore finding it easier to maintain a low BMI level.The study took age, sex, social class and other factors into account. \"The comfortable temperature of 20degC -23degC is where we feel comfortable in our clothes and are neither hot nor cold.At temperatures above this, we use more energy and we eat less because our appetite is affected.\" The findings of the research can be described as   _  .

The Mexica supplied the Tepaneca with warriors for their successful conquest campaigns in the region and received part of the tribute from the conquered city states. In this way, the prestige and economy of Tenochtitlan gradually grew.  In 1396, at Acamapichtli\\'s death, his son Huitzilihhuitl (Nahuatl: \"Hummingbird feather\") became ruler; married to Tezozomoc\\'s daughter, the relation with Azcapotzalco remained close. Chimalpopoca (Nahuatl: \"She smokes like a shield\"), son of Huitzilihhuitl, became ruler of Tenochtitlan in 1417. In 1418, Azcapotzalco initiated a war against the Acolhua of Texcoco and killed their ruler Ixtlilxochitl. Even though Ixtlilxochitl was married to Chimalpopoca\\'s daughter, the Mexica ruler continued to support Tezozomoc. Tezozomoc died in 1426, and his sons began a struggle for rulership of Azcapotzalco. During this struggle for power, Chimalpopoca died, probably killed by Tezozomoc\\'s son Maxtla who saw him as a competitor.  Itzcoatl, brother of Huitzilihhuitl and uncle of Chimalpopoca, was elected the next Mexica tlatoani. The Mexica were now in open war with Azcapotzalco and Itzcoatl petitioned for an alliance with Nezahualcoyotl, son of the slain Texcocan ruler Ixtlilxochitl against Maxtla. Itzcoatl also allied with Maxtla\\'s brother Totoquihuaztli ruler of the Tepanec city of Tlacopan. The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan besieged Azcapotzalco, and in 1428 they destroyed the city and sacrificed Maxtla. Through this victory Tenochtitlan became the dominant city state in the Valley of Mexico, and the alliance between the three cities provided the basis on which the Aztec Empire was built.  Itzcoatl proceeded by securing a power basis for Tenochtitlan, by conquering the city-states on the southern lake - including Colhuacan, Xochimilco, Cuitlahuac and Mizquic. These states had an economy based on highly productive chinampa agriculture, cultivating floating gardens in the shallow lake Xochimilco. Itzcoatl then undertook further conquests in the valley of Morelos, subjecting the city state of Cuauhnahuac (today Cuernavaca).\\n\\nAnswer this question \"who conqured the lakes\" by extracting the answer from the text above.

Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew\\'s voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory\\'s successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist. The geologist, Hartley Ferrar, was a 22-year-old recent Cambridge graduate who Markham thought \"might be made into a man.\" Marine biologist Thomas Vere Hodgson, from Plymouth Museum, was a more mature figure, as was the senior of the two doctors, Reginald Koettlitz, who, at 39, was the oldest member of the expedition.

Ted Stevens, indicted Tuesday on seven counts of making false statements on Senate financial disclosure forms, has a long history in the Senate. Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens was charged Tuesday with making false statements on financial disclosure forms. And in the last few years, the Alaska Republican has been a poster boy for congressional spending critics. In 2005, legislation backed by Stevens to build a so-called \"bridge to nowhere\" became a lightning rod for those critics. The proposal called for construction of a $223 million bridge to connect Alaska\\'s Gravina Island -- population 50 -- to the mainland. The allocation was backed by Stevens and Alaska Rep. Don Young, then the powerful GOP chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Congress later rescinded the earmarked funding for the bridge. The project also drew the ire of Sen. John McCain, now the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, who has long chastised Congress for wasteful spending. He has cited the \"bridge to nowhere\" in several campaign speeches this year. During the primaries, McCain said politicians\\' pet projects could have played a role in the Minnesota bridge collapse in early 2007. \"Maybe if we had done it right, maybe some of that money would have gone to inspect those bridges and other bridges around the country,\" McCain said in Ankeny, Iowa, on August 4, 2007. \"Maybe the 200,000 people who cross that bridge every day would have been safer than spending ... your tax dollars on a bridge in Alaska to an island with 50 people on it.\" While the Arizona senator has long fought earmarks, he never specifically went after the \"bridge to nowhere,\" and he was absent for key votes on its funding, according to FactCheck.org. Stevens, 84, is the oldest Republican senator and second in age only to Sen. Robert Byrd, the 90-year-old Democrat from West Virginia. Stevens is up for re-election in 2008. The former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee has represented Alaska in Washington since 1968 and is renowned for his prowess in steering federal funds to his vast, sparsely populated state. Stevens is the Senate\\'s president pro tempore emeritus; co-chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee; vice chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; and ranking member of the Disaster Recovery Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee. \"During World War II, he joined the Army Air Corps and flew support missions for the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force. Stevens was awarded numerous medals for his service, including the Distinguished Flying Cross,\" according to his Senate Web site. After the war, Stevens attended and graduated from both UCLA and Harvard Law School, and later practiced law in Alaska. He later moved to Washington to work in President Dwight Eisenhower\\'s White House. After his stint in the White House, Stevens moved back to Alaska and ran for state representative. He was elected to the Alaska House in 1964. Four years later, Stevens was appointed to the U.S. Senate. In 1970, he was elected to finish his term in a special election mandated by state law, according to Stevens\\' Web site.  He has since been re-elected six times.\\n\\nWhat are highlight points for this article? [/INST]',\n",

Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia. The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians. In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.\\nWhat group was excluded from high offices ?

The bleaching process will dry your hair out significantly, potentially causing damage and breakage. Your hair\\'s natural oils will prevent this. A freshly-washed scalp is also much more sensitive and will itch more during bleaching. Your bleach kit will have two main components: dry powdered bleach and a hydrogen peroxide solution. Mix the two according to the ratios or instructions on your dye kit, using a tint brush or plastic spoon.  Follow the instructions on your kit if they are different from what is described here. Developers come in different strengths rated by numbered \"volumes.\" If your hair is already fairly light, use volume 10. Volume 20 is for darker blondes, volume 30 for light browns, and volume 40 for darker browns and black.  Higher volumes can be more damaging to your hair, but they can also lighten it faster. If you\\'ve never bleached your hair to platinum blonde before, you will need to know how long it takes your hair to lighten. Select a small amount of hair close to the roots at an inconspicuous place and section it off. Brush on some bleach using a tiny brush. Let the bleach set and check the strand every 5 to 10 minutes. If your hair is not light enough after an hour, you will need to do multiple rounds of bleaching. Rinse the bleach away between rounds and reapply it. To minimize damage, do not leave bleach in your hair for over an hour. Use a tint brush to apply your bleach mixture evenly to your hair. Work in sections, brushing in the direction your hair grows.  Start from the very back of your head and work your way forward, leaving the sections of hair that frame your face for the end. If your hair is thick, flip up each section to expose the next layer of hair underneath and apply there, too. Leave about a one-inch section around your roots to do last, after the face-framing strands. The heat from your scalp will cause your roots to bleach a little faster than your normal hair. Try to go as quickly as possible to ensure an even color. Refer back to the results of your strand test to determine how long you should leave the bleach in your hair. Cover your hair up with either a shower cap or plastic wrap while you wait. Keep in mind that a little itchiness on your scalp is normal. Use warm water without shampoo. Be very careful to not get any bleach in your eyes as you rinse. If possible, ask someone to rinse your hair for you in a sink while you look up as if you were in a salon. If you aren\\'t immediately moving on to the next step, allow your hair to air dry. Blow drying can further strip your hair of moisture, potentially exacerbating any damage the bleach has caused.\\n\\nSummary: [/INST]',\n",

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \"Dog paddle,\" and we all laughed. \"Tiger paddle,\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons\\' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water.

It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. It lies in a tunnel in circumference, as deep as beneath the FranceSwitzerland border near Geneva, Switzerland. Its first research run took place from 30 March 2010 to 13 February 2013 at an initial energy of 3.5\\xa0teraelectronvolts (TeV) per beam (7\\xa0TeV total), almost 4 times more than the previous world record for a collider, rising to 4 TeV per beam (8 TeV total) from 2012. On 13 February 2013 the LHC\\'s first run officially ended, and it was shut down for planned upgrades. \\'Test\\' collisions restarted in the upgraded collider on 5 April 2015, reaching 6.5 TeV per beam on 20 May 2015 (13 TeV total, the current world record). Its second research run commenced on schedule, on 3 June 2015.  - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26\\xa0million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2\\xa0million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters.  - Charles University, known also as Charles University in Prague  is the oldest and largest university in the Czech Republic. Founded in 1348, it was the first university in Central Europe. It is one of the oldest universities in Europe in continuous operation and ranks in the upper 1.5 percent of the worlds best universities.  - The Cavendish experiment, performed in 17971798 by British scientist Henry Cavendish, was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant. Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish\\'s work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell\\'s original plan. Cavendish then carried out a series of measurements with the equipment and reported his results in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" in 1798.  - Physics (from , from \"phúsis\" \"nature\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5\\xa0million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2\\xa0million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia.  - Experimental physics is the category of disciplines and sub-disciplines in the field of physics that are concerned with the observation of physical phenomena and experiments. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations, such as the Cavendish experiment, to more complicated ones, such as the Large Hadron Collider.  - Vincenc Strouhal ( enk Strouhal ) ( April 10 , 1850 -- January 26 , 1922 ) was a Czech physicist specializing in experimental physics .

The man began to tell us he wanted to borrow some money for the night and that he had a job but no place to live and was waiting for his first paycheck. He confirmed he could get our mailing address and mail the money back to us. The guy I was with reached into his pocket to give this man a $20 bill. As the man was extending his hand out to take the money, I put my hand on my new friend\\'s hand and said, \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I told him some people earned money by begging and that they always cheated those with soft hearts.

Question: what is harrison's first name Context: Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.\\nA: [/INST]\",\n",

The Affair of the Placards began in 1534, and started with protesters putting up anti-Catholic posters. The posters were not Lutheran but were Zwinglian or \"Sacramentarian\" in the extreme nature of the anti-Catholic content—specifically, the absolute rejection of the Catholic doctrine of \"Real Presence.\"  Protestantism became identified as \"a religion of rebels,\" helping the Catholic Church to more easily define Protestantism as heresy. In the wake of the posters, the French monarchy took a harder stand against the protesters. Francis had been severely criticized for his initial tolerance towards Protestants, and now was encouraged to repress them.  At the same time, Francis was working on a policy of alliance with the Ottoman Empire.  The ambassadors in the 1534 Ottoman embassy to France accompanied Francis to Paris.  They attended the execution by burning at the stake of those caught for the Affair of the Placards, on 21 January 1535, in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. John Calvin, a Frenchman, escaped from the persecution to Basle, Switzerland, where he published the Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536. In the same year, he visited Geneva, but was forced out for trying to reform the church. When he returned by invitation in 1541, he wrote the Ecclesiastical ordinances, the constitution for a Genevan church, which was passed by the council of Geneva.\\n\\nQuestion: Which event happened first, the Affair of the Placards or the return to Geneva by John Calvin?\\n\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

This will roll back your computer\\'s settings to the date that you select. Any changes made to the system since the date will be undone. This means that programs that you\\'ve installed since the selected date will be removed, and settings will be reverted. A system restore will not affect your personal files. The fastest way to open it is to search for it, though the process varies a little depending on the version of Windows you are using:  Windows 10 and 8.1 - Click the Start button and type \"recovery\". This will load the Recovery window in the Control Panel. Select \"Open System Restore\". Windows 7 and Vista - Click the Start button and type \"restore\". Select \"System Restore\" from the list of results. Restore points are created automatically whenever a change is made to your system files, such as installing a program or driver. Windows will choose the most recent restore point automatically. To view all available restore points, check the \"Show more restore points\" box. Choose a restore point from a date when you know your wireless adapter was working. Since restoring will roll your computer back to the date you select, programs that have been changed in that time will be affected. Click the \"Scan for affected programs\" button to see what will be removed or added back to your computer during the restore. Remember, your personal files will not be affected. Once you\\'ve selected your restore point and confirmed that you want to restore, Windows reboot and roll back. This may take a few moments to complete. Once the restore is finished, Windows will load and you will be informed that the restore was successful. If there was a driver or software problem causing a problem with your wireless adapter, restoring to a point before the problem occured should fix it.

The car is based on the B ( Project 188 ) platform , originally used for the second - generation Fiat Punto . The Idea is noted for its versatile interior , which includes sliding and folding rear seats . In 2006 the Idea had a facelift with the main changes being a darker interior , chrome grill and clear front indicators .  - A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. Depending on the type of van it can be bigger or smaller than a truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, minivans, are commonly used for transporting people from a family. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.  - A compact MPV is a car classification used in Europe to describe multi-purpose vehicle versions of small family cars (sometimes also referred to as \"compact cars\"), fitting between the mini MPV and large MPV sub-segments. In Japan, the term \"space wagon\" is sometimes used to refer to this type of vehicle.  - Mini MPV (short for mini multi-purpose vehicle) is a car classification used in some countries to describe superminis or subcompacts which have taller build and often with a flexible interior layout, fitting below the compact MPV and large MPV/Minivan classifications. MPV stands for multi-purpose vehicle, although the full name is rarely used. The term Leisure Activity Vehicle (LAV) is sometimes used for van based MPVs, but this marketing term is largely ignored by the press, normally using the term MPV.  - Supermini (also called B-segment across Europe) is a class of automobile larger than a city car but smaller than a small family car.  - Governments and private organizations have developed car classification schemes that are used for innumerable purposes including regulation, description and categorization, among others.

For example, a ream of 20 lb, 8.5 in × 11 in (216 mm × 279 mm) paper weighs 5 pounds, because it has been cut from a larger sheet into four pieces.

White Lies is a story about the nature of identity: those who deny it and those who strive to protect it. Paraiti is a medicine woman. She is the healer and midwife of her rural, tribal people - she believes in life. But new laws are in force prohibiting unlicensed healers. On a rare trip to the city, she is approached by Maraea, the servant of a wealthy woman, Rebecca, who seeks her knowledge and assistance in order to hide a secret which could destroy Rebecca's position in European settler society. If the secret is uncovered a life may be lost, but hiding it may also have fatal consequences. So Paraiti, Maraea and Rebecca become players in a head on clash of beliefs, deception and ultimate salvation.In the Extras of the DVD, Witi Ihimaera, tells how his mother took him to Paraiti, a tohunga/healer who cured him of a breathing problem. In writing the story, he wanted to honour the various tohunga in Maori life.   In 1907, the New Zealand government brought in  The Tohunga Suppression Act, thus outlawing natural healing for Maori. Some people believe the author of the book drew on the life of Anglo-Indian actress Merle Oberon, and the hiding of her true ethnic origin.\\nAnswer: [/INST]\",\n",

Then, the door to opera opened through television, the NBC Opera Theater series. In February 1955, she sang Puccini\\'s Tosca for the NBC Opera Theater, under music director Peter Herman Adler, becoming the first African American to appear in a leading role in televised opera. Several NBC affiliates (not all Southern) canceled the broadcast in protest. She returned in three other NBC Opera broadcasts, as Pamina (1956), Madame Lidoine in Poulenc\\'s Dialogues of the Carmelites (1957), and Donna Anna in Don Giovanni (1960).  In March 1955, she was auditioned at Carnegie Hall by the Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan, who was then touring with the Berlin Philharmonic. Impressed with her singing of \"Pace, pace, mio Dio\" from Verdi\\'s La forza del destino, Karajan reportedly leapt to the stage to accompany her himself. Calling her \"an artist of the future\" he asked her management for control of her future European career. Over the next three seasons, Price crossed the U.S. in recitals with her longtime accompanist, David Garvey, and in orchestral appearances. She also toured India (1956) and Australia (1957), under the auspices of the U.S. State Department. She sang a concert version of Aida--her first public performance of the role--at the May Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on May 3, 1957.  Her first appearance on the grand opera stage occurred in San Francisco on September 20, 1957, singing Madame Lidoine in the U.S. premiere of the Dialogues of the Carmelites. A few weeks later, Price sang her first on-stage Aida, stepping in for Italian soprano Antonietta Stella, who was suffering from appendicitis. The following May, she made her European debut, as Aida, at the Vienna Staatsoper on May 24, 1958, at Karajan\\'s invitation and under his baton. Debuts followed at London\\'s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (replacing Anita Cerquetti), and at the Arena di Verona, both as Aida. The next season she returned to Vienna to sing Aida and her first onstage Pamina in The Magic Flute, repeated her Aida at Covent Garden, sang operatic scenes by R. Strauss on BBC Radio, and made her debut at the Salzburg Festival in Beethoven\\'s Missa Solemnis, under Karajan.  The close artistic understanding between Karajan and Price was reflected in many of her early career successes in the opera house (Mozart\\'s Don Giovanni, Verdi\\'s Il trovatore and Puccini\\'s Tosca), in the concert hall (Bach\\'s Mass in B minor, Beethoven\\'s Missa Solemnis, Bruckner\\'s Te Deum, and the Requiems of Verdi and Mozart), and in the recording studio (complete recordings of Tosca and Carmen, and a bestselling holiday music album, A Christmas Offering). Most of her recordings and many of her live performances have been released on CD.  On May 21, 1960, Price made her first appearance at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, again as Aida, becoming the first African American to sing a leading role in Italy\\'s greatest opera house. (In 1958, Mattiwilda Dobbs had sung Elvira, the secondary lead soprano role in Rossini\\'s L\\'italiana in Algeri.)\\n\\nAnswer this question \"Did she get an award?\" by extracting the answer from the text above.

Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes. David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United after the owners, the Glazer family, finally lost patience with the club’s dismal season. United are confident of landing Holland coach Louis van Gaal as his replacement once they have tied up details of their manager’s severance. The Barclays Premier League champions have already made contact with the Dutchman and he wants to join United after the World Cup. The Old Trafford board planned to sack. Moyes — just a year into a six-year contract — at the end of the season. but will now bring forward that announcement after news of their. intentions was reported by MailOnline on Monday afternoon. End of the line: David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United and could leave before the end of the season. Under pressure: United crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Moyes's former club Everton on Sunday, their 11th defeat of the Premier League season. Searching for inspiration: Moyes has found it impossible to maintain the high standards set by predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson. Bright beginnings: Moyes started work at Old Trafford on July 1 last summer, having been announced as Ferguson's replacement in May. Played 51Won 27Drawn 9Lost 15Win percentage 52.94. Moyes, on a day off on Monday, had still not been contacted by the club on Monday night and is understood to be hurt and angry after learning of his fate on newspaper websites. He will attend trainingat Carrington today but may well not survive the week. Player-coach Ryan Giggs is lined up to replace him until the end of the season, alongside fellow Treble winner Nicky Butt, as United try to salvage some pride by finishing in the Europa League places at least. Sir Alex Ferguson, who appointed Moyes, is expected to have little or no say in who the next manager will be. News of the 50-year-old’s imminent departure broke on Monday in the wake of Sunday’s defeat at his old club Everton. However, it is understood the club decided to look for alternatives after the 2-0 reverse in the Champions League at Olympiacos in February. Meet the new boss: Moyes gets to work on his first morning as United manager at the club's Carrington training complex. Backing: Supporters on the Stretford End commissioned a banner proclaiming Moyes as the 'Chosen One' Good start: Moyes lifts the Community Shield after United beat Wigan 2-0 at Wembley back in August. It will be his only piece of silverware with the club. Winning start: United won 4-1 at Swansea City on the opening day of the season, getting their title defence off to the perfect start. Warm reception: Moyes is introduced to the Old Trafford crowd prior to his first home game against Chelsea. April 26 Norwich City (H)May 3 Sunderland (H)May 6 Hull City (H)May 11 Southampton (A) The Glazers, who are due in Manchester next week, had been supportive of Moyes but have sensed since the turn of the year that results and performances were getting worse and that some of United’s senior stars had simply stopped playing for their manager. They want to appoint a new manager — preferably Van Gaal — as soon as possible so they can tie up deals for players including. Southampton’s Luke Shaw before the World Cup. United know that it will be hard enough to attract players this summer without Champions League football and didn’t want to continue the negotiating process with a manager who had become a lame duck. Certainly not many United players will be disappointed to hear the news. Even those who like Moyes realised that things were not working, an impression that hardened when the Scot walked into the dressing room at Goodison Park on Sunday afternoon and told his team they had played well. Taste of defeat: Moyes suffered his first league loss at Anfield as a Daniel Sturridge gave Liverpool a 1-0 win on September 1. Down to work: Moyes leads a training session at Carrington ahead of his first Champions League match with United back in September. Euro stars: United beat Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 at Old Trafford in their opening Champions League fixture of the season. Nightmare: The scale of Moyes's task at Old Trafford became apparent in the 4-1 defeat at rivals Manchester City on September 24. Bad to worse: Moyes can't believe his misfortune as United are beaten at home by West Bromwich on September 28. If talks with Van Gaal don’t work out as expected, United will consider alternative targets such as Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti. At 62, Van Gaal is a relatively old manager, but after the experiment with Moyes, United are aware they need a coach with the presence and the experience to cope with a club of their size and profile. United old boy Phil Neville may survive the backroom cull, as may goalkeeping coach Chris Woods after his exceptional work with David de Gea this season. Masterstroke: Moyes did persuade star striker Wayne Rooney to turn down the overtures of Chelsea and sign a new contract. Revenge: United knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup at the third round stage, offering swift retribution for the Anfield loss. Passion play: Moyes celebrates Javier Hernandez's goal as United beat Stoke City 3-2 at Old Trafford. Low point: Moyes sits and considers his options as United lose 1-0 to his former club Everton on December 4. Row: Moyes grabs the ball from Hatem Ben Arfa as Alan Pardew looks on during December's 1-0 home loss to Newcastle United. Race is on: Moyes runs along the touchline to retrieve the ball during United's New Year's Day loss to Tottenham. Protest: Moyes runs on to the pitch to appeal after a blatant handball is not given in the Tottenham match. No luck: Moyes rues a missed chance as United slipped to a 2-1 defeat to Sunderland in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final. Out: With coach Phil Neville after United were knocked out of the Capital One Cup on penalties by Sunderland. January sales: Moyes bought Juan Mata from Chelsea for £37m in a bid to revive the flagging season. Nadir: United produced their most miserable performance of the season as they were beaten 2-0 by Olympiacos in the first leg of their last 16 Champions League tie. The great turnaround: But a Robin van Persie hat-trick gave United a 3-0 win at Old Trafford and took them through to a last eight encounter with Bayern Munich. Anger: A fan remonstrates with Moyes during the 3-0 home defeat by Manchester City. Guarded: Stewards protect the 'Chosen one' banner on the Stretford End at the end of the City defeat. Stunt: Disgruntled United fans paid for this plane to fly over the ground during a home match with Aston Villa. The plane's appearance was roundly booed by United fans in the ground. Good display: United produced their best performance of the season in the 1-1 home draw with Bayern Munich. Beyond them: But Bayern came from behind in the second leg in Munich to win 3-1 and knock United out of the Champions League. Waving goodbye: The final straw was United's 2-0 loss at Goodison Park on Sunday.\\n\\nHighlights: [/INST]\",\n",

Having visited nearly half a dozen times over the years, and somehow not managing to share it on my blog over the years, I would say that although you could visit from London for the day, I wouldn’t. Go for a minimum of an overnight stay, or a few days if you can. Witness a misty morning, and a candy coloured sunset, wander out into the Dales or slip in a seaside visit somewhere like Scarborough, and really get to know the ancient city. Alas, I haven’t really learned how to take my own advice, but hot on the end of a family visit in Lincolnshire we were lucky enough to spend sometime with one of my favourite expats on Yorkshire (ok, ok, I only know two, but they are definitely in the top two of that limited ranking system). It was of course Amanda, her fabulous husband Sam and we got to meet their gorgeous new addition to the family, a mischevious Dachshund pup who goes by the name of Harold. Instagram was alive with “OOOOOOOH MY GOD YOU GOT TO MEET HAROLLLLLD” Forget being a rockstar in this day and age, puppy dog eyes are all you need to make ladies weep and then squeal into their keyboards. We tumbled off the train, cheeks ruddy from the fresh the North Sea breezes (fresh from visiting the Seal colony with a litany of pups at Donna Nook, and nibbling fish and chips with the family in Cleethorpes) and went wandering. I’m going to make a big claim here – if you’re travelling through the UK and can only fit in one city visit outside of London, York or perhaps Bath would be excellent choices. Compact enough to really explore, full of ancient buildings and history, and good cake. What more do you even need?

This causes an electrical current to begin flowing in the direction of the signal's instantaneous field. When the resulting current reaches the end of the conductor, it reflects, which is equivalent to a 180 degree change in phase. If the conductor is 1⁄4 of a wavelength long, current from the feed point will undergo 90 degree phase change by the time it reaches the end of the conductor, reflect through 180 degrees, and then another 90 degrees as it travels back. That means it has undergone a total 360 degree phase change, returning it to the original signal. The current in the element thus adds to the current being created from the source at that instant. This process creates a standing wave in the conductor, with the maximum current at the feed.\\nWhat part of the radio signal creates voltage? [/INST]\",\n",

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000\\u2002b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur\\xadgundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar\\xadseilles) around 600\\u2002b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125\\u2002b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \"Gallic barbarians,\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50\\u2002b.c. Caesar drew Gaul\\'s northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger\\xadman\\xadic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. \\nWhat question would one ask from this paragraph? [/INST]',\n",

Is America finally ready to have a conversation about gun control? Here\\'s what people are saying: Joe Scarborough gave an impassioned speech on Morning Joe this morning. \"From this day forward, nothing can ever be the same again,\" he declared. Scarborough earned the NRA\\'s top rating while in Congress, but he said that on Friday he realized \"that the ideologies of my past career were no longer relevant ... It is time for Congress to put children before deadly dogma.\" It\\'s absolutely OK to politicize this situation, writes Michael Grunwald at Time. \"The kind of people who believe politics is inappropriate at times like this tend to be the kind of people who believe politics is trivial entertainment.\" Policies have consequences, and \"now is the time to debate them, not to STFU.\" \"We should mourn, but we should be angry,\" writes EJ Dionne in the Washington Post, calling for bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, background checks, and other reforms. \"If Congress does not act this time, we can deem it as totally bought and paid for by the representatives of gun manufacturers.\" But David Frum thinks President Obama is the wrong man to lead the charge. \"If the president—any president—inserts himself into the gun debate, he will inevitably polarize it,\" he reasons at CNN. An outside group modeled on Mothers Against Drunk Driving would be more effective. \"Only that way can the campaign avoid being held hostage\" by partisanship. Not everyone agrees that it\\'s time to act. \"The chances of being killed in a mass shooting are about what they are for being struck by lightning,\" points out John Fund at the National Review, arguing that gun control will be ineffective and even counterproductive. Shootings most often occur in so-called \"gun-free zones\" like schools, or, as one ex-sheriff calls them \"helpless-victim zones.\"\\n\\nExpand this summary. [/INST]',\n",

Ufa was retaken on 13 March; by mid-April, the White Army stopped at the Glazov-Chistopol-Bugulma-Buguruslan-Sharlyk line. Reds started their counteroffensive against Kolchak's forces at the end of April. The Red 5th Army, led by the capable commander Tukhachevsky, captured Elabuga on 26 May, Sarapul on 2 June and Izevsk on the 7th and continued to push forward. Both sides had victories and losses, but by the middle of summer the Red Army was larger than the White Army and had managed to recapture territory previously lost. Following the abortive offensive at Chelyabinsk, the White armies withdrew beyond the Tobol. In September 1919 a White offensive was launched against the Tobol front, the last attempt to change the course of events. However, on 14 October the Reds counterattacked, and thus began the uninterrupted retreat of the Whites to the east. On 14 November 1919 the Red Army captured Omsk. Adm. Kolchak lost control of his government shortly after this defeat; White Army forces in Siberia essentially ceased to exist by December. Retreat of the eastern front by White armies lasted three months, until mid-February 1920, when the survivors, after crossing Lake Baikal, reached Chita area and joined Ataman Semenov's forces.

This is who I am; I can\\'t retire really from myself.\" It is, then, no surprise that award-winning Mtukudzi, who is affectionately called Tuku by his fans, decided to mark his birthday last September with the release of yet another album. Called \"Sarawoga,\" which means \"left alone\" in Shona, Mtukudzi\\'s latest album is a tribute to his beloved son Sam, who died in a car crash in 2010 aged 21. Watch Mtukudzi performing. The recording comes after a long period of grief for the soft-spoken artist. \"I\\'m still learning to live with it,\" says Ntukudzi, who had written and rehearsed many of the album\\'s songs with his son; Sam was a highly talented multi-instrumentalist himself who pursued his own music career but would also often perform with his father. \"I\\'ve only released my first offering this year and for the past two years I didn\\'t even think about my music really,\" says Ntukudzi. \"I was just thinking of him and trying to recover, even though music was my therapy. I think I\\'ve performed more shows since 2010 up to today than ever before because that\\'s the only therapy I\\'ve got.\" Read related: Afrobeats going global. Born into a musical family in 1952, Mtukudzi has been successfully performing for nearly four decades throughout Africa as well as in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. His foot-stomping music has been described as a mixture of Zimbabwean pop style \"jit\" and South African township pop. Through his distinct sound and inspiring lyrics, he\\'s documented the joy and pain of his countrymen who fought for freedom under colonial rule and died for democracy after Zimbabwe\\'s independence in 1980. \"Where I come from you don\\'t get to sing a song if you have nothing to say,\" says the musician, who grew up in Highfield, a ghetto neighborhood in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare. \"So every song has something to do with that man in the street, he must be able to use it in his life.\" As a young boy, Mtukudzi joined choirs to improve his singing talent and taught himself how to play a three-string guitar. He soon started writing and recording songs and after an illustrious career he is today one of Zimbabwe\\'s best-known musicians. Read related: The man who brought MTV to Africa. More than just an entertainer, Mtukudzi is committed to addressing everyday social challenges, using his music as a vehicle to speak about the issues he\\'s passionate about. In 2003 he founded an art center in Norton, near Harare, and last year he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for eastern and southern Africa, focusing on youth development and HIV/AIDS. Mtukudzi, who lost his brother Robert and several band members to AIDS, recently took his campaign to eradicate the HIV/AIDS stigma to mothers in Tanzania. He is also outspoken against patriarchy and has criticized polygamy as a practice that increases the risk of spreading HIV. But as well as tackling heated and important issues with his songs, the artist-turned-activist has also been producing and starring in feature films since the early 1990s, using his celebrity to empower and influence others. Released in the early 1990s, feature film \"Neria\" questions the place of tradition in the life of contemporary African women. The theme song remains to this day one of Mtukudzi\\'s most popular tracks. \"I know sound is OK but visual can be better ... because it sticks in your head,\" he says. \"If you see things you get to understand things much better than when you just hear things. That\\'s why we do short films and try and show them to the people.\" Read related: Malian kora legend breaks music barriers. Back at the Market Theater, a few minutes before his sold-out concert begins, Mtukudzi admits that he still doesn\\'t known which songs from his long repertoire he will play to his audience.

I just look for the first song -- if I find the first song everything falls into place, because I don\\'t know the mood of the day, so as I get into the mood I get the songs.\" What\\'s more certain, however, is that his audience is in for a memorable show.\\nSummarize the highlights of this article.

From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \"abiding passion of his life\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams\\'s crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation.

The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. \\n\\nQuestion: \"Why do critics feel the law is unnecessary?\"\\n\\nAnswer: \"Women who wane to get abortion will go to a different state\"\\n\\nIs this answer to the question correct?\\nOPTIONS:\\n(1). no\\n(2). yes [/INST]',\n",

Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.

He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull\\'s penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \"miracle cure\" company who was along those lines! \"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won\\'t likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn\\'t explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I\\'m gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I\\'ll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally.

His parents were Maronite Catholic immigrants from Lebanon. Kairouz and Taouk are two prominent families from Bsharri. Thomas was raised in Toledo, Ohio, attending St. Francis de Sales Church (Roman Catholic), Woodward High School, and finally the University of Toledo, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.\\nContext: Thomas enjoyed a successful 11-year run (1953-1964) on Make Room For Daddy, later known as The Danny Thomas Show. Jean Hagen and Sherry Jackson were his first family. The Hagen character died in 1956, replaced by Marjorie Lord. Jackson left the series in 1958, and Penny Parker replaced her in the 1959-1960 series. Parker was written out of the series with her marriage to the character Patrick Hannigan, played by comedian Pat Harrington, Jr. Lord and Harrington died a few weeks apart between November 2015 and January 2016.  On January 1, 1959, Thomas appeared with his other Make Room For Daddy child stars, Angela Cartwright and the late Rusty Hamer, in an episode of NBC\\'s The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.  The show was produced at Desilu Studios, where Lucille Ball was appearing alongside Desi Arnaz Sr. in I Love Lucy, and it featured several guest stars who went on to star in their own shows, including Andy Griffith (The Andy Griffith Show, Mayberry RFD), Joey Bishop, and Bill Bixby (My Favorite Martian and others). He also scored a major success at the London Palladium, in the years when many big American stars appeared there.  In 1970, the program was revived for a season under the title Make Room for Granddaddy. (See below.)  Angela Cartwright (who spoke about her on- and off-camera relationship with her TV stepfather, Danny Thomas, on a groundbreaking ABC TV show, Make Room for Daddy) had said: \"I thought Danny was hilarious and he was always cracking me up. He was loud and gregarious, nothing like my real Dad who is far more reserved than that. So, it was fun to be able to make smart remarks and get away with it. I would never have talked to my real parents that way, but in the make-believe world of the Williams family I got away with that.\" Cartwright also added that by the time Thomas\\' show had ended, she wanted to join the cast of The Sound of Music: \"I went on an interview for the part of Brigitta. I was still filming The Danny Thomas Show, but I knew the series was coming to an end. After several auditions, I was the first von Trapp cast. I asked Danny Thomas if he would let me out of my contract so I could be in the movie and he was very gracious to let me out of the last show of the season.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A Wanted Man - A Jack Reacher Novelâ\\x80\\x99 by Lee Child - NYTimes.com\\n“A Wanted Man” is Lee Child’s 17th Jack Reacher novel and the last to be published before Reacher goes Hollywood with “Jack Reacher,” a big Christmas movie based on book No. 9, “One Shot,” and starring — can’t say it ain’t so, because it is — Tom Cruise. Mr. Cruise seems such a wrong choice to play this jumbo vigilante that this is a good moment to contemplate the essential Reacher: not just what he looks like but also what he really is.\\n\\nPerhaps in sly response to a movie that will feature a lot of action, Mr. Child begins “A Wanted Man” by confining Reacher to very close quarters. The first 125 pages of this new novel are about a car trip. After waiting exactly 93 minutes on the eastbound ramp of a Nebraska highway, he successfully hitches a ride. The car contains two men and a woman, and Reacher knows nothing about them. Being Reacher, he will spend those first 125 pages observing every detail, watching every move, trying to deduce as much as he can.\\n\\nHis enormous size counts for nothing during this part of the book. Nor does his appearance, although he has a busted nose and is said to resemble a very un-Cruise-like “gorilla with its face smashed in.” And he has no opportunities to resort to his tactic of choice, extreme violence. So he rides along an endless straight road through Iowa thinking about codes and signs and numbers and letters (“Reacher had no patience with people who claimed that y was a vowel”). He is a math guy at heart, and he isn’t likely to meet anyone equally wonky until this series takes him through Silicon Valley.\\n\\nOn the road Reacher gradually figures out that the men, Alan King and Don McQueen, are kidnappers. Their hostage is Karen Delfuenso, a terrified waitress whose car they have hijacked. Reacher arranges to drive the car with Karen in the seat behind him so that they can make eye contact in the rearview mirror. Improbably Karen starts blinking and twisting her head to deliver some kind of secret message. Even more improbably, Reacher cracks her code almost immediately and finds out what she is trying to say.\\n\\nA third of the way into “A Wanted Man,” his only acts of violence have been hypothetical. “It was technically challenging to take out a guy in the front passenger seat while driving at 80 miles an hour,” he muses while at the wheel. Also, the 6-foot-5-inch Reacher has arms so long that he would need to keep his elbow bent: he wants to slug his passenger, not punch out the car’s side window. In any case, it’s time for Mr. Child to get him out of the car and unleash him on the book’s assorted evildoers.\\n\\nOutside the car, meanwhile, “A Wanted Man” has been developing one of the best female characters in the whole Reacher series: Julia Sorenson, an F.B.I. special agent from Omaha who is called in to investigate a potential interstate crime. Once Reacher is sprung from the car, he encounters Sorenson, who ought to be his natural adversary. But she, like all the women who interest Reacher, is as smart and methodical as he is, and he impresses her with his irrefutable, conveniently self-serving logic. He easily convinces her that whatever is unfolding, he and she should be on the same side.\\n\\nReacher’s banter is usually more elegant than it is in “A Wanted Man.” He can do better than this, which he aims at a trucker who is bothering him: “Option 1, get back in your truck and get breakfast 50 miles down the road. Option 2, get in an ambulance and get breakfast through a plastic tube.” Still, the sang-froid of his delivery is what makes the big impression. And anyone worried about Reacher on screen can rest easy. Just remember how dauntingly Mr. Cruise can deliver that kind of dialogue, how greatly the character’s intelligence outshines his brawn, and how formidable Reacher would be even if he didn’t tower over everyone around him. Size doesn’t matter, as you will see in December.\\n\\nSince Mr. Child’s titles tend to be so generic (No. 18 will be “Never Go Back”), “A Wanted Man” is best thought of as the one with the car ride across the Midwest. But it eventually expands into something gigantic: a scheme involving an alphabet soup of federal agencies and the obligatory foreign terrorists operating on American soil.\\n\\nQuick action and solid detective work elevate the second part of this book until it segues into one of the best of the series’s climactic assaults: the expected, wildly over-the-top moment when Reacher must single-handedly penetrate some kind of huge, geometrically interesting, top-secret high-security fortress. This book’s version of that structure is described with clarity. And Reacher, who has been idly showing off his familiarity with Midwestern area codes, soil content and urban population counts, snaps into murderously good form. In this book he seems newly thoughtful about mortality, particularly his own.\\n\\nReacher’s vigilante ethics, à la Dirty Harry’s, are likely to fuel much more controversy in a movie than they do on the page. But these smart, breathless books have no trouble justifying their hero’s acts of vengeance. And “A Wanted Man” is more ingenious than other Reacher books have been about the underground activities Reacher is thwarting. Mr. Child’s endings would be even better if his books’ worst bad guys, besides being swarthy and disposable foreigners, were given tough-guy talents of their own.\\nWhat was this article about?

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history.\\n\\nPrior to the 1999 free-agency period, the Rams chose Warner to be one of the team\\'s five unprotected players in the 1999 NFL Expansion Draft. Warner went unselected by the Cleveland Browns, who chose no Rams and whose only quarterback selection was Scott Milanovich.  The Rams let Bono leave in free agency and signed Trent Green to be the starter. Banks was traded to the Ravens, and Warner now found himself second on the depth chart. After Green tore his ACL in a preseason game, Rams coach Dick Vermeil named Warner as the Rams\\' starter. In an emotional press conference, Vermeil--who hadn\\'t seen Warner work with the first-string offense--said, \"We will rally around Kurt Warner, and we\\'ll play good football.\" With the support of running back Marshall Faulk and wide receivers Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Az-Zahir Hakim, and Ricky Proehl, Warner put together one of the top seasons by a quarterback in NFL history, throwing for 4,353 yards with 41 touchdown passes and a completion rate of 65.1%. The Rams\\' high-powered offense, run by offensive coordinator Mike Martz, was nicknamed \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" and registered the first in a string of three consecutive 500-point seasons, an NFL record.  Warner threw three touchdown passes in each of his first three NFL starts; he is the only NFL quarterback in history to accomplish that feat. Warner drew more attention in the Rams\\' fourth game of the season, a home game against the San Francisco 49ers (who had been NFC West division champions for 12 of the previous 13 seasons). The Rams had lost their last 17 meetings with the 49ers, but Warner proceeded to throw a touchdown pass on each of the Rams\\' first three possessions of the game, and four touchdowns in the first half alone, to propel the Rams to a 28-10 halftime lead on the way to a 42-20 victory. Warner finished the game with five touchdown passes, giving him 14 in four games and the Rams a 4-0 record. Warner\\'s breakout season from a career in anonymity was so unexpected that Sports Illustrated featured him on their October 18 cover with the caption \"Who Is This Guy?\" He was named the 1999 NFL MVP at the season\\'s end for leading the Rams to their first playoff berth since 1989 (when they were still in Los Angeles) and their first division title since 1985.  In the NFL playoffs, Warner ultimately led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. In the game, he threw for two touchdowns and a then Super Bowl-record 414 passing yards, including a 73-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce when the game was tied with just over two minutes to play, which proved to be the game-winning score. Warner also set a Super Bowl record by attempting 45 passes without a single interception. For his performance, Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what team did kurt play for in the 1999 season [/INST]',\n",

We say you're 'in the pink' when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good. The color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'. Some people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful (  ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him.

If you wish,you can even work on a river boat. So what will become of the office tomorrow?It is possible that many could go into computer space creating a new wave of virtual  offices. To minimize office in innercity areas, companies will have a work force made up of a network of home workers linked by an advanced communication and information system. A central processing computer would be controlled by the manager who sends out work schedules and oversees  the activity of each employee. A video screen would be created,as the need for email or telephone becomes greater. Seeing the mood and expressions of work colleagues, managers would have the ability to view several employees at once on their screen. Employees would be encouraged to feed any information that may be useful to fellow workers into the computer to make the company work more effectively. As the company's lifeblood, the computer would contain a record of all conversations and communication for future reference and hold secret information such as accounts in password  protected areas.

A Canadian porn actor accused of dismembering his Chinese lover and mailing the body parts to political parties and schools has collapsed in court today, during the second week of his preliminary hearing. Luka Magnotta, 30, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the gruesome slaying and dismemberment of Jun Lin last May. He is accused of killing the university student and posting a video online that shows him stabbing and having sex with the dismembered corpse. Scroll down for video. Tumble: Wearing a black sweater with colored stripes, Magnotta, shown in a court sketch from today, appeared distressed during a video evidence session, before collapsing. Wearing a black sweater with colored. stripes, Magnotta appeared distressed during a video evidence session. this morning. The evidence is subject to a publication ban, until it is. determined that there is enough evidence to go to trial. He held his hand over his mouth and asked the guard in his glass-enclosed defendant's box for a five-minute break. He stood up and collapsed on the floor just after the judge agreed to an extended lunch break. According to Canadian Press, he was all of a sudden lying on his right side, crumpled into a fetal position, in the courtroom, still handcuffed and shackled. Overcome: The suspect, pictured in court sketch, held his hand over his mouth and asked the guard in his glass-enclosed defendant's box for a five-minute break. 'You might want to make room for an ambulance,' the Crown prosecutor, Louis Bouthillier, told the guards outside the courtroom. 'Somebody's collapsed.' Canadian Press said Magnotta's eyes were fixed on the ground not on the screen where the, presumably gruesome, video evidence was being shown. When he began covering his mouth, his lawyers came to check on him and 10 minutes into that segment of the hearing he asked the baliff to his side to request the break. As well as first-degree murder, Magnotta is also facing four other charges relating to the case. He is accused of dismembering Lin and mailing parts of his body across Canada, before leading police on an international manhunt before he was finally arrested in Germany. Grisly: Porn actor Luka Rocco Magnotta (left) is. accused of chopping up his boyfriend Jun Lin (right) and eating a part. of his body. Grim death: Lin, pictured, was a Chinese student studying in Montreal. Sick: Magnotta, pictured left and right, was looking at the ground not on the screen where the, presumably gruesome, video evidence was being shown. Lin's parents were not in the. courtroom on Tuesday morning. His father has attended the preliminary. hearing, which began March 11, sporadically but has not stayed in the courtroom when the most. graphic evidence has been heard. The. porn actor first appeared in court last Monday as his lawyers. unsuccessfully sought to close pre-trial proceedings to the press and. public. Magnotta has observed all hearings from a glass enclosure in the packed Montreal court room. During the proceedings, which are expected to last another one to two weeks, prosecutors are outlining the case against 30-year-old Magnotta and seek to persuade a judge they have enough evidence for the case to go to trial. On March 11, appearing for the first time since soon. after his June arrest, Magnotta wore a white T-shirt and khaki trousers,. leaning back in his chair as he listened to legal arguments. Also. in the courtroom was Diran Lin, father of victim Jun Lin, whose. dismembered body parts were mailed to schools and political parties in. the Canadian capital Ottawa and Vancouver in a crime that shocked Canada. and gained international notoriety. All eyes on me: A court sketch of Luka Rocco Magnotta as he appears for a preliminary hearing on March 11 in Montreal, Canada. He accused of murdering and dismembering his Chinese boyfriend. Ordeal: Daran Lin, father of murder victim Jun Lin heads to court with a translator in Montreal on Monday. His son was allegedly dismembered by Magnotta and his body parts mailed to political parties and schools. Magnotta is accused of first-degree murder, interfering with a dead body and other charges. He has pleaded not guilty. 'This. is the worst thing a family can endure. We are empty,' the Journal de. Montreal quoted Diran Lin as saying in an interview ahead of the. hearing. 'We had so much hope for Jun Lin.' Police say the video, which they believe is genuine, showed a man stabbing his victim to death before dismembering the corpse and then eating part of the body. Lin's hands and feet were mailed in May to the offices of political parties in Ottawa and to schools in Vancouver. His torso was found in a pile of garbage behind Magnotta's Montreal apartment, and his head was discovered in a Montreal park in July. Lin was a student at Concordia University in Montreal. Initial arguments revolved around an unusual defense request to exclude the public and the media, which was denied. The court imposed a publication ban on the evidence presented.

But it seems that besides wearing a mask, few of us know what has caused the smog and what to do to beat it. Chai Jing, a former news interviewer with CCTV, discussed the questions in her documentary Under the Dome. The 103-minute film was on websites on Feb 28. In the film, Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists. She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2.5 and smog. To solve the problem, Chai suggests that we should clean our coal and oil or replace them with cleaner energy such as natural gas. In her film, Chai also emphasized   that everyone can do something to help control smog too. For example, we can live a greener life by using more public transport. Or if we see things that could harm the environment, we can try to stop it. In the film, when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities  , she calls the hotline 12369.

From the kinds of questions I put to him the agent could tell that I knew nothing about insurance, so he kindly offered to explore the matter with me in more detail---to help me determine the kind of policy I ought to be considering. That evening he appeared at my door promptly  at 7:30; without wasting time on pleasantness, he spread his papers out on the kitchen table and launched into a lengthy explanation. I listened attentively as he talked about the difference between various types of policies, and he explained the kind of coverage he felt I ought to have. Toward the end of the evening (after three or four hours of talking), he kindly helped me fill out an application for a $50,000 policy, and then he asked if I could go to a Dr. Luther's office on Friday for a physical examination. I don't know why, but it was not until the mention of the doctor's appointment that I realized fully what was happening. I was about to sign a lifetime contract, yet I had not really made a decision about whether I wanted to buy the policy. However, since he had spent so much time with me, I didn't want to make him feel that he had wasted his time. So I invented an excuse about things I had to do on Friday, and I assured him I would call him in a few days. Actually, I had no intention of going to see Dr. Luther or of calling the agent again. I wanted to forget the whole thing. It's been over three months now since our meeting, and my friendly insurance agent still calls at my office faithfully two or three times a week.

       " '<s>[INST] Question: You are given a new situation: David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.  and a hint : Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \"propaganda pheromones\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour\\'s glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra\\'s conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra\\'s second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was $5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra\\'s international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra\\'s principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\nAnswer: [/INST]\",\n",

Sydneysiders who opted for a late-night stroll by the ocean would have been treated to a romantic sight on Sunday night as the ocean literally glowed blue with each rolling wave. As delighted Manly Beach locals shared snaps of the strange phenomenon across social media,\\xa0Iain Suthers from the University of New South Wales told Daily Mail Australia that the strange glow is likely to continue over the next few days before dispersing over the weekend. The oceanography expert said the colourful display was nothing to be concerned about, describing it as 'a seasonal event, welcoming the early stages of spring'. A local photographer captured the bright blue glow of the waves on Sydney's Manly beach on Sunday night. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which\\xa0blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Mr\\xa0Suthers said. 'It has organs inside its cells which allow it to bioluminate. It is really common in the deep ocean and only occurs at night when the animals - like squid or fish, bacteria or single cell pytoplantuum - use it to communicate. 'They might just have bacteria they have on their bodies, or they have their own enzymes to make themselves glow.' Mr Suthers, who researched the environmental spectacle 10 years ago, said that the algae appears due to a certain sequence of events that occur in the ocean, but that the exact environmental recipe for its occurrence is still unknown. The colour came from a group of single-celled phytoplankton at the waters surface, called Noctiluca scintillans. The cells glow when they senses a pressure change, which indicates that a predator is about to eat them. 'They probably started up off the coast of Port Stephens, where the eastern Australian current separates from the coast,' Mr Suthers said of Sunday night's event. The natural oceanographic up-welling of nutrients which occurs in this area, as well as the nutrients from the recent rainfall, followed by the stable calm conditions and plenty of sunlight, are likely to have brought the algae to the surface. Mr Suthers explained that the\\xa0bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. The natural phenomenon is not dangerous, according to oceanography expert Iain Suthers, and is likely to last for the next few night. 'It eats these diatoms and grows and blooms and divides and it fills the water column and they float to the surface as a whole when the population starts to age,' he said. 'These cells glow at night, at any stage of their life, from when they first start to divide. 'What causes it is a little pressure from the breaking of wave or when you dive in to the water- any sense of pressure change like that, indicates that a predator is about to eat them. 'And so they give off this beautiful bioluminescence signal to warn off any potential predators trying to have a go at them.'\\n\\nWhat are highlight points for this article? [/INST]\",\n",

Park's district made the students work in groups at all times, the students from Lake's district were instructed to work by themselves and in isolation.  and a hint : When peer feedback is established it allows students to interact with their peers and creates high social skills while learning material more effectively. Interaction with other students allows students to have better social approaches when interacting. Learning by peer feedback gives students more of an opportunity to work as a unit instead of individuals working alone. Working in groups gives students more useful life skill that well help prepare them for the future. Peer feedback gives more control to the student, the student can decide if they want to use the criticism their peers are giving them or not. When given options more students are more likely to give and absorb more feedback. Peer feedback has confirmed an increase in affect; students that have increasing responsibilities have more drive towards their work and a spike in confidence.[6] Furthermore, Kristanto (2018) found that peer feedback is an essential element of peer assessment.

A mathematics prodigy, he abandoned an academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle, then between 1978 and 1995 he killed three people, and injured 23 others, in a nationwide bombing campaign targeting those involved with modern technology. In conjunction, he issued a social critique opposing industrialization and advancing a nature-centered form of anarchism.\\n\\nAt Harvard, Kaczynski lived during his first year at 8 Prescott Street, which was designed to accommodate the youngest, most precocious freshmen in a small, intimate living space. The next three years he lived at Eliot House. One of his suitemates there recalled that he avoided contact with others and \"would just rush through the suite, go into his room, and slam the door.\" Another suitemate said Kaczynski was reserved, but regarded him as a genius: \"It\\'s just an opinion - but Ted was brilliant.\" Other students stated Kaczynski was less socially averse than these descriptions imply; an Eliot House resident who dined with Kaczynski at times called him \"very quiet, but personable ... He would enter into the discussions maybe a little less so than most [but] he was certainly friendly.\"  As a sophomore, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alton Chase as a \"purposely brutalizing psychological experiment\", led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student, and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who in a later session would confront and belittle the subject - making \"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\" attacks - using the content of the essays as ammunition, while electrodes monitored the subject\\'s physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects\\' expressions of rage were later played back to them repeatedly. The experiment ultimately lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week. In total, Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study. Kaczynski\\'s lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to this experience. Some sources have suggested that Murray\\'s experiments were part of the US government\\'s research into mind control, known as Project MKUltra. Chase and others have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski\\'s criminal activities, while philosopher Jonathan D. Moreno has said that, while \"Kaczynski\\'s anti-technological fixation and his critique itself had some roots in the Harvard curriculum,\" Kaczynski\\'s later bombing campaign can \"by no means be laid at Harvard\\'s door\".  Kaczynski earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1962. He finished with an above-average 3.12 GPA but had been expected to perform better.\\n\\nWas his behaviour in later life attributed to the experiments? [/INST]',\n",

Thomson grew up on Staten Island in New York City and signed with the New York Giants for a $100 bonus right out of Curtis High School in 1942.\\n\\nLongstanding rumors that the Giants engaged in systematic sign stealing during the second half of the 1951 season were confirmed in 2001. Several players told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on July 20, the team used a telescope, manned by coach Herman Franks in the Giants clubhouse behind center field, to steal the finger signals of opposing catchers. Stolen signs were relayed to the Giants dugout via a buzzer wire. Joshua Prager, the author of the Journal article, outlined the evidence in greater detail in a 2008 book.  Although Thomson always insisted that he had no foreknowledge of Branca\\'s pitch, Sal Yvars told Prager that he relayed Rube Walker\\'s fastball sign to Thomson. Branca was privately skeptical of Thomson\\'s denials but made no public comment at the time. Later he told The New York Times, \"I didn\\'t want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball. And even if Bobby knew what was coming, he had to hit it.... Knowing the pitch doesn\\'t always help.\" Whether the telescope-and-buzzer system contributed significantly to the Giants\\' late-season 37-7 win streak remains a subject of debate. Prager notes in his book that sign stealing was not specifically forbidden by MLB rules at the time and, moral issues aside, \"...has been a part of baseball since its inception\". Sign stealing using optical or other mechanical aids was outlawed by MLB in 1961.  Thomson however, late in his life, rebuked his prior claims of not receiving the sign on the Shot Heard \\'Round the World, and admitted that the sign was received.\\n\\nWhat was the controversy about?

The remainder of the movie portrays the annunciation (conception) and birth of Jesus Christ to explain why King Herod the Great (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) ordered the murder. The film then goes back one year before the massacre, to Jerusalem where Zachariah is a rabbi and making an offering, when he gets told by the Archangel Gabriel that his wife will bear a son by a vision. He states that he is too old, and is told by Gabriel that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. It then goes to the town of Nazareth, where a teenaged girl named Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is farming, and soldiers come to collect taxes, one man, who is unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into debt slavery to pay his debt. Mary is then, betrothed to marry Joseph of Judaea (Oscar Isaac), is visited by the Angel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God\\'s son, whom she is to name \"Jesus\". He then tells that her God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) with a child despite her old age. Mary asks her parents and Joseph could she visit with Elizabeth before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth and her husband the priest Zachariah (Stanley Townsend), who regains his speech after he refused to believe the Angel Gabriel\\'s news that he would have a son.

Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,899 square miles (181,040 km2), with 68,595 square miles (177,660 km2) of land and 1,304 square miles (3,380 km2) of water. It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines the placement of the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”. What does Harrison Ford do? - He is an actor. - He is an evolutionary biologist. - not enough information - He is a palaeontologist.\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

The questions will prompt you to explain how your personal attitude and skill-set will apply to this new job.  If you are applying for a job that involves customer service, then you will probably be asked questions about past experiences handling customers. How have you dealt with angry customers? How have you gone out of your way to satisfy customers?  If you are applying for a job that will entail working in a team, then some of the interview questions may revolve around your past experience working in teams. How have you taken charge or helped balance a team?  If the potential job involves emergency response or high-pressure situations, then many of the behavioral interview questions will seek to understand how you behave under pressure. Think about times when you have reacted calmly and decisively to a high-pressure situation. Read over lists of the most common interview questions. If you are applying to a big-name company that fields a lot of applicants, then search online for the accounts of others who have interviewed for the same job at the same company. You don't need to rehearse and regurgitate a scripted answer. You only need to be able to reference examples that paint you in a positive light. Before the interview, make a short list of situations and projects from past jobs that might be relevant to this new position.  Try to remember the details. If you cannot clearly explain what you did in a situation, then you should not use that situation as an example. Consider sketching out potential answers beforehand. Again: no need to memorize them!

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley\\'s first release, on the Sun label\", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \"essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction\": \"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\". In \"That\\'s All Right\", the Presley trio\\'s first record, Scotty Moore\\'s guitar solo, \"a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\" While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \"rockabilly\\'s originator\", Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that \"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn\\'t create rockabilly.\" and, according to Michael Campbell, \"Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\" In Moore\\'s view, too, \"It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\"At RCA, Presley\\'s rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher, more intense manner. While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard \"Blue Moon\" at Sun to the country ballad \"How\\'s the World Treating You?\" on his second LP to the blues of \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP Peace in the Valley. Certified as a million seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.

These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\".

The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Movie title: Anna Karenina Movie plot: Anna Karenina is a young and elegant wife of Alexei Karenin, a wealthy nobleman twenty years her senior. She is unhappy and lives only for their son, Seriozha. During a ball in Moscow, she encounters the handsome Count Alexei Vronsky. Vronsky is instantly smitten and follows her to St. Petersburg, pursuing her shamelessly. Eventually, Anna surrenders to her feelings for him and becomes his mistress. Though they are happy together, their relationship soon crumbles after she miscarries his child. Karenin is deeply touched by her pain and agrees to forgive her. However, Anna remains unhappy and, to the scandal of respectable society, she openly leaves her husband for Vronsky. Using her brother as an intermediary, Anna hopelessly begs her husband for a divorce. Karenin, under the poisonous influence of her friend the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, indignantly refuses to divorce and denies Anna any access to Seriozha. Distraught by the loss of her son, Anna grows severely depressed and self-medicates with laudanum. Before long, she is hopelessly addicted. With Vronsky she has another child, but he is also torn between his love to Anna and the temptation of a respectable marriage in the eyes of society. Anna becomes certain that Vronsky is about to leave her and marry a younger woman. She travels to the railway station and commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Vronsky is emotionally devastated by her death and volunteers for a \\'suicide mission\\' in the Balkan war. While travelling to join his regiment, he encounters Konstantin Levin at the train station. Levin has married Vronsky\\'s former (and unrequited) sweetheart, Princess \"Kitty\" Shcherbatsky. Levin attempts to persuade Vronsky of the value of life. Vronsky, however, is now despondent, and can only speak of how Anna\\'s body looked at the railway station when he arrived to see her.

Article: A 14-year-old girl was attacked by a grey bear while competing in a bike race. She managed to whisper the word \"bear\" to her rescuer. The girl suffered serious head, neck and leg wounds. Now she is in a dangerous condition in hospital. The girl was taking part in a 24-hour race through Bicentennial Park in Alaska when she was attacked by the bear. Bicentennial Park is next to Chugach State Park where some wild animals live.      The animal attacked the girl in a heavily wooded area at about 1:30 am. The girl called emergency services but she was unable to say any word. Another rider Peter Basinger found her lying unconscious on the ground. He told the Anchorage Daily News that she managed to say the word \"bear\" when he stopped to help. Her helmet had been ripped off   in the attack and rolled into the woods. Mr. Basinger waited with the girl for about 20 minutes until doctors arrived. Armed police trekked    3 km with doctors to pick up the girl.      Animal expert Rick Sinnott said something must be done as soon as possible to prevent the bear from attacking people again. \"It was extremely terrifying,\" he said.      Mr. Sinnott told the Anchorage Daily News that the bear might be a mother. It hurt two runners on a nearby path two weeks ago. He also said that the girl was lucky to have been wearing a bike helmet because the bear had bitten her head several times. Question: When the girl was attacked, she was   _  .

I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it.

Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant\\'s radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \"of the order of tons\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This... contains an answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who calculated the critical mass of uranium?, what is it ?\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

Article: Chinese students have tended to come to the UK at a younger age in recent years, which means they come to Britain not only for higher education, but also for high school or even primary school. Asian investors  have followed this trend, and started to buy independent schools to serve this demand. An article carried by theTimes of London on October 17 reported that last year Chinese-owned company Achieve Education bought Chase Grammar, a boarding and day school in Cannock, Staffordshire. Chase Grammar includes a program that offers extra support for pupils from China. \"This trend is very good and I am not at all surprised,\" Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, told theGlobal Times, adding that Chinese people like the English education system. \"We welcome Chinese investors in British private education.\" \"Chase Grammar School is small, and the classes are small. It gives the school a family atmosphere,\" Jackie Medhurst, principal of Chase Grammar School, said in a welcome note on the school\\'s website. Small class sizes, personal care, good exam result, and entry to world famous universities are features that are most attractive to Chinese students. But many parents are also worried that foreign investors might expand the proportion of international students, and that might _ the British tradition. It seems that Chase Grammar does not intend to hide their attempts to attract Chinese families. It has set up a China office in Shanghai to facilitate Chinese parents\\' communication with the school. Tong Zhou, a director of Chase Grammar, told the media that the school does not intent to change the ratio of local students and international students. Some international branches of British boarding schools are very popular in Asia. In recent years, the Chinese passion for the British boarding school system has led some of the best-known schools such as Harrow and Wellington to set up satellite schools in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

This is in contrast to some (largely communist or ex-communist) countries where not only are there provisions for air defence in the army, navy and air force but there are specific branches that deal only with the air defence of territory, for example, the Soviet PVO Strany.

Plot title: The Swarm Movie plot: A group of soldiers led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman) is ordered to investigate a basement level station which they believed was attacked. After Baker contacts his commander, Gen. Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate who drove a civilian van into the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass (revealed to be bees), but the two helicopters are swarmed by the bees and explode, killing the pilots inside. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base\\'s doctors, supports Crane\\'s story.Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens) who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation.Recovering from his earlier bee attack, the stung son and some friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, who head to Marysville.

One day a merchant brings musical instruments to sell to Peewit, the court jester, but because Peewit is such a terrible musician the King throws the merchant out before Peewit arrives. However he has left behind a flute that only has six holes. The King throws it into the fireplace in his room, which starts to emit green smoke. When the fire is put out, Peewit retrieves the flute from the ashes unharmed. He cleans it and starts playing it for the whole castle realizing that it causes everyone to dance when it is played. That night a man named Matthew McCreep learns from the merchant that the same flute he had been looking for is at the castle. He heads over to the castle and steals the flute from Peewit. The king sends Peewit and the young knight Johan out to catch McCreep who uses the flute to rob people of their money. However McCreep uses the flute to stop them. Johan and Peewit then go to the house of Homnibus the wizard. Using a spell called Hypnokenesis, the wizard sends Johan and Peewit to Smurfland where the magic flute was built. Upon arriving they meet a smurf who leads them to the village. Papa Smurf greets the two of them and tells them that they'll make a new flute in order to counter McCreep's flute.

       " \"<s>[INST] Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance and authenticity?  New York Dolls is the debut album by the American hard rock band New York Dolls. It was released on July 27, 1973, by Mercury Records. In the years leading up to the album, the New York Dolls had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, most music producers and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion; the group later appeared in exaggerated drag on the album cover for shock value. After signing a contract with Mercury, the New York Dolls recorded their first album at The Record Plant in New York City with producer Todd Rundgren, who was known for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporated carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity. New York Dolls was met with widespread critical acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners. The band proved difficult to market outside their native New York and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses while touring the United States in support of the album. Despite its commercial failure, New York Dolls was an influential precursor to the 1970s punk rock movement and has since been named in various publications as one of the best debut records in rock music and one of the greatest albums of all time.\\nA: [/INST]\",\n",

Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his egotism. With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended.\\n\\nThe whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six hour film or a TV mini-series. It would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at West Point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. It would talk about his service in the Phillipines as a young officer, his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France. It would also have to tell about him firing on the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on any chances President Herbert Hoover had of getting re-elected. During MacArthur's last years he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. That must have been a subject they avoided.\\n\\nThis film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Phillipines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by President Truman.\\n\\nMacArthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It's the part of the film I enjoyed the best, seeing MacArthur and his relations with both these men.\\n\\nFDR by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness. Sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake, but he was the master politician of the last century. Note how he deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time.\\n\\nTruman by Flanders is as people remember him, a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked MacArthur's haughtiness from the gitgo. Of course it's in the history books how Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt about it.\\n\\nYet I could write a whole thesis on the Truman-MacArthur relations. Along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis. I've always felt that FDR would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then.\\n\\nMacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender, at MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree.\\n\\nIs the sentiment of this review positive or negative? [/INST]\",\n",

Coming to prominence while a member of Count Basie\\'s orchestra, Young was one of the most influential players on his instrument. In contrast to many of his hard-driving peers, Young played with a relaxed, cool tone and used sophisticated harmonies, using what one critic called \"a free-floating style, wheeling and diving like a gull, banking with low, funky riffs that pleased dancers and listeners alike\". Known for his hip, introverted style, he invented or popularized much of the hipster jargon which came to be associated with the music.\\nContext: In 1933 Young settled in Kansas City, where after playing briefly in several bands, he rose to prominence with Count Basie. His playing in the Basie band was characterized by a relaxed style which contrasted sharply with the more forceful approach of Coleman Hawkins, the dominant tenor sax player of the day. One of Young\\'s key influences was Frank Trumbauer, who came to prominence in the 1920s with Paul Whiteman and played the C-melody saxophone (between the alto and tenor in pitch).  Young left the Basie band to replace Hawkins in Fletcher Henderson\\'s orchestra. He soon left Henderson to play in the Andy Kirk band (for six months) before returning to Basie. While with Basie, Young made small-group recordings for Milt Gabler\\'s Commodore Records, The Kansas City Sessions. Although they were recorded in New York (in 1938, with a reunion in 1944), they are named after the group, the Kansas City Seven, and comprised Buck Clayton, Dicky Wells, Basie, Young, Freddie Green, Rodney Richardson, and Jo Jones. Young played clarinet as well as tenor in these sessions. Young is described as playing the clarinet in a \"liquid, nervous style.\"  As well as the Kansas City Sessions, his clarinet work from 1938-39 is documented on recordings with Basie, Billie Holiday, Basie small groups, and the organist Glenn Hardman. Billie and Lester met at a Harlem jam session in the early 30s and worked together in the Count Basie band and in nightclubs on New York\\'s 52nd St. At one point Lester moved into the apartment Billie shared with her mother, Sadie Fagan. Holiday always insisted their relationship was strictly platonic. She gave Lester the nickname \"Prez\" after President Franklin Roosevelt, the \"greatest man around\" in Billie\\'s mind. Playing on her name, he would call her \"Lady Day.\" Their famously empathetic classic recordings with Teddy Wilson date from this era.  After Young\\'s clarinet was stolen in 1939, he abandoned the instrument until about 1957. That year Norman Granz gave him one and urged him to play it (with far different results at that stage in Young\\'s life--see below).\\nQuestion: What other bands was Billie in?\\n\\nAnswer: [/INST]',\n",

Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture\\'s lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes\\' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl\\'s arrest due to his defiance of the studio\\'s orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. After this, the matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word \"Kong\". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack. Back on the ship, they lighten their load to float off the rocks and carry out repairs, but Jack discovers Ann has been kidnapped and another sailor has been killed. The natives offer Ann as a sacrifice to Kong, a 25 feet (7.6 m) tall gorilla. The crew returns fully armed, but is too late as Kong takes Ann and flees into the jungle. Though initially terrified, Ann wins Kong over with juggling and dancing, and begins to grasp Kong\\'s intelligence and capacity for emotion.\\nA: [/INST]',\n",

It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it\\'s not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I\\'ll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb  and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn\\'t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.\" She continued, \"The stress and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed--incapable of doing anything.\" It\\'s important to remember to let go of your stress.

The range of evolutionary theories during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" included forms of \"saltationism\" in which new species were thought to arise through \"jumps\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress.

He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It\\'s not much information to go on, but it\\'s a good starting point for Timmy.  But I can use this background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \"Trends in the Periodic Table,\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.

Children are less prone to willful blindness or inability to see injustices and problems. Just by being around children more, and really listening to them and paying attention to what they do, you can start to uncurl from your crusty shell of cynicism and let yourself become more childlike, playful and creative.  Children can cut through the layers of obfuscation which adults use to excuse stupid decisions, procrastination and inaction. Children also don\\'t mind displaying a sense of awe about the world around them, constantly delighting in new discoveries and in making amazing new connections – between ideas, people and the wider world. Recognize in your time spent with children that we are born as blank slates, not for causing harm or trouble to others. Having a fixed view of human beings as cruel, mean-spirited and selfishly adhering only to what\\'s best for each person is both unhelpful and generally untrue. How often do you ask people to recall the happy memories and what makes them happy now? People love talking about what they care about, what motivates them and what makes them happy and yet it\\'s not always an obvious topic for general conversation. It\\'s really important to provide the space for people to open up about their happy moments – it helps them to articulate in front of an audience what matters most to them (and may thereby inspire them even further) and it will help you to see the lighter, brighter and happier side of the people in your life. There is a plethora of positive, inspiring and uplifting stories about the good that people do each day. Yet, much of this positive news gets buried under the sensational, negative coverage that news media seems to prefer. All the same, it is possible to actively choose to increase your exposure to positive news. For example, you can subscribe to news feeds online that only focus on positive stories. And you can selectively follow social media network friends and fans who deliberately choose to share good news rather than bad and who are regularly sharing inspiring things. Check out such sites as the Good News Network, Happy News, The Huffington Post Good News, or Daily Good. These sorts of sites focus on positive news stories and gather together many kind, caring and warm tales about the good things that human beings do. Whether it\\'s the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, the local zoo trying to conserve animals or a faith-based charity, informing yourself about their activities will remind you that people are actively involved in helping others, conserving the environment, restoring the land, caring for animal welfare and lobbying government to make changes that will improve lives and livelihoods. Browse your local bookstore or library shelves for amazing stories about people in the business world who are transforming society at the same time as running a business. Such businesses are changing the way we \"do business\" and see the world, including in such areas as sharing of information, making games that educate as well as bring enjoyment, selling fair trade or fairly sourced products, producing eco-friendly items and financial projects that help people to borrow for or invest in small projects that benefit many people in local communities. Social entrepreneurs focus heavily on ensuring that their business makes a positive difference in the world. [/INST]',\n",

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Patsy Douglas comes up with an ingenious way to get a seat on the crowded New York subway: she pretends to have a baby, using a doll discarded by the advertising agency where she works. One day, however, her agency\\'s primary client, short-tempered Cyrus Baxter, happens to be seated beside her. (His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam.) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her \"child\" Cyrus after him. He becomes acquainted with her, letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman. Later, when the agency\\'s two bosses, Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign, he insists they keep her happy, to their puzzlement. Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter\\'s mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend\\'s identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter\\'s temper improves under Patsy\\'s influence. When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth, Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter, but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract. She reluctantly agrees, after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter\\'s business, throwing hundreds out of work. When Morley shows Baxter a photograph of the baby (actually a picture of his partner as a child), Baxter notices a resemblance to Holmes and assumes he is the father. To placate him, Morley arranges for Holmes to start dating Patsy. In the process, however, he becomes jealous, having fallen in love without realizing it.\\nThe answer to this question is: [/INST]',\n",

After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera (Karra Elejalde), to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find. Massera\\'s research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela\\'s death. He teams up with tabloid journalist Quiroga (Tristan Ulloa), a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia\\'s phone number written on the label. The tape shows what appears to be the murder or torture of a naked woman, and also footage of Claudia when she visited the derelict clinic. Visiting a theological expert at the university, the two begin to uncover a bizarre cult called The Nameless that is said to sacrifice children. The cult was led by a now-imprisoned man called Santini who believed in absolute evil, and created his cult which also links to Germany\\'s Thule Society. A doctor who helped him was also arrested but was released for lack of evidence. To make matters worse, Claudia finds herself stalked by psychotic...\\nThe answer to this question is: [/INST]',\n",

From the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of Blacks moved to Detroit to escape Jim Crow laws in the south and find jobs. However, they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city—through violence, laws, and economic discrimination (e.g., redlining). White residents attacked black homes: breaking windows, starting fires, and exploding bombs. The pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs.

Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

The map shows the Pacific island nation of Palau in relation to China. Details of the transfer are still being worked out, Ambassador Hersey Kyota told CNN. But Kyota said his country, a former U.S. Pacific trust territory, has agreed to take in the ethnic Uighur detainees \"for humanitarian reasons\" and because of the \"special relationship\" between Palau and the United States. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly would not comment on the announcement, telling reporters, \"We\\'re still involved in ongoing discussions.\" The agreement includes some U.S. aid for Palau, Kyota said, but he said those details remained to be worked out as well. The country, with a population of about 20,000, is about 1,000 miles southeast of Manila, Philippines, and about 4,600 miles west of Hawaii. Palau has received nearly $900 million in U.S. aid since independence in 1994, according to congressional auditors, and depends on Washington for defense. The \"Compact of Free Association\" between Palau and the United States is up for review, but Kelly said any additional aid offer \"is not linked to any other discussions we may be having with the government of Palau.\" The Uighurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan. \\n\\nQuestion: \"What country has a population of 20,000?\"\\n\\nAnswer: \"Phillipines\"\\n\\nIs this answer to the question correct?

The statement also said Trump\\'s action is a display of \"incoherence and inconsistency.\" \"Germany stands by the jointly agreed communique,\" Germany spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.

The high-speed Tokaido Shinkansen largely parallels the line.  - , also referred to as , is one of the Japan Railways Group (JR Group) companies and operates in western Honshu. It has its headquarters in Kita-ku, Osaka.  - A suburb is a residential area or a mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city. In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \"suburb\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \"neighborhood\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county.  - The Japan Railways Group, more commonly known as , consists of seven for-profit companies that took over most of the assets and operations of the government-owned Japanese National Railways on April 1, 1987.

In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.  answer the following question:  Which old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house?\\nThe answer to this question is: [/INST]\",\n",

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An unnamed gunslinger referred to as The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1881, where she enters a single elimination gunfighting contest held by Redemption\\'s ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort\\'s life by shooting the rope Herod\\'s men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \"The Kid\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father\\'s respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod\\'s own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn\\'t have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn\\'t shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn\\'t fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his boat empty and he always went down to help him carry in the fishing lines or take down the old, patched sail. \"Santiago,\" the boy said to him as they dragged up the boat to the sand. \"I could go with you again.

In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary\\'s very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary\\'s roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \"Mary Brave\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori\\'s rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. When the three are jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents. While Paulie tends to the orphaned falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys\\' school. One of the boys, Jake Hollander (Luke Kirby), flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother\\'s 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy\\'s interest in her, saying, \"He liked my tits.\" When Mary asks if she\\'ll go to the party, Tori says, \"And have all those gross guys groping me?

Matty attacks Casey, smashing the mirror on her head, and tells her: \"Jumby wants to be born now\". She puts him to bed and leaves in shock. Casey\\'s friend Romy tells her of a superstition that newborns should not see their reflections in the mirror for at least a year because otherwise they will die soon.

As such, look for training classes approved by at least one of the two boards, meaning they follow the organization’s official regulations and are run by a society-certified instructor. The SPCP and AAM maintain lists of certified trainers on their official websites. Due to microblading’s boom in popularity, lots of for-profit training classes have popped up around the world. Avoid classes that are under 100 hours long or make no mention of the AAM or SPCP. Though some of these classes provide accurate training, many are scams and few will get you closer to official certification. Scam courses are often less than 6 days long, extremely cheap, or advertise the inclusion of a free microblading kit. After finding a good class, enroll with the instructor, pay any required fees, and attend. Expect to work for at least 100 hours with the time divided into class study, homework, live practice, and teacher demonstrations. If AAM and SPCP trainers do not live in your area, travel will most likely be required. Most full courses cost between $4000 and $5000. Expect to take off work for about 1 week in order to attend. Make sure this documentation includes how many hours you worked and has your instructor’s official signature. In addition, with the model or patient’s consent, make sure you take photos of any live work completed.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and thus too old to enlist.\\n\\nFollowing her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at DEC, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky\\'s boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.  Hopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity.

Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed (Ex parte Quirin) under their sentences. Also during this time, a joint US/UK code-breaking effort (the Venona project)—with which the FBI was heavily involved—broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes, allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications. This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence. Hoover was administering this project but failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) until 1952. Another notable case is the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957.

Pro football teams are notoriously reluctant to reveal any information on player injuries, but since six different Browns have caught the bug since 2005 \\x97 Winslow has had it twice \\x97 the team\\'s medical management looked suspect to some observers. \"There\\'s obviously a problem [with staph] and we have to fix it,\" Winslow told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \"Just look at the history around here. It\\'s unfortunate, because it happens time and time again.\" The Browns, who denied that they had kept the news of his infection from his teammates, suspended Winslow one game for his rant, which included his claim that he felt like he had been treated like \"a piece of meat.\"\\n\\nBut the Winslow medical controversy wasn\\'t even the worst of it for the league. In the past week, it has become clear that two of its most marketable stars, marquee quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, had gotten infections. The New England Patriots\\' Brady has had at least two additional infection-related procedures since his initial season-ending knee surgery in September. It\\'s now possible that his knee will have to undergo another operation, which could delay his return until 2010. Staph seems to be the likely culprit, but neither Brady nor the Patriots will confirm that. During training camp staph infected a bursa sac, which acts as a cushion between bones, in Manning\\'s left knee. The infection required surgery and forced him to miss most of the preseason. Though the Colts released a statement on Friday insisting Manning didn\\'t contract a more perilous staph, the anti-biotic resistant strain known as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), the incidents should alarm the NFL. \"The NFL, and all the leagues, should be diligent, and not let their guards down,\" says Dr. Robert Gotlin, director of Orthopedic and Sports Rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. \"They\\'ve got to do better. It\\'s got to be one of the top five priorities.\"\\n\\nThe recent cases have certainly gotten players\\' attention. \"I\\'m concerned, and wondering why it\\'s happening. It\\'s not some little infection that goes away in a few days, it\\'s pretty serious,\" says Chicago Bears rookie running back Matt Forte. The league is quick to point out that it has partnered with teams to educate players about the bacteria, while the players\\' union insists it\\'s alarmed and has contacted the league about further action. Some teams, like the Colts, have posted pictures on training room walls that warn players about staph symptoms and how to avoid contracting or spreading it. For their part, the Browns note that the team has previously used a special anti-staph agent to disinfect the locker room, weight room and other places where players gather.\\n\\nStaph, of course, is far from just an NFL problem. Two college teams, the \\'05 Florida Gators and the \\'03 USC Trojans, had multiple cases. And football is by no means the only sports victim. The infection kept Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Rios out of the 2006 All-Star Game. A few days later another Toronto player caught it, and the clubhouse was disinfected. NBA players Paul Pierce, Grant Hill and Drew Gooden have had it. Staph killed a high school wrestler in California this summer, and last spring 15 students at a Pennsylvania high school were either treated for staph or symptoms caused by the virus.\\n\\nWhat exactly are staph infections? Staph is bacteria carried on the skin, which can enter the body through a cut or during a medical procedure, causing the infection. Most are minor, but certain strains are particularly resistant to anti-biotics and can cause athletes to miss significant playing time. Athletes are more likely to suffer cuts, and the locker room setting bunches players close to one another in a warm, damp environment, so they are especially susceptible to spreading the bacteria. Since football teams carry some 55 players on their rosters, and tend to have a higher degree of serious injuries to deal with, they are at particular risk. According to a 2005 survey by the NFL Team Physicians Society, 13 out of 30 teams that responded had had a player contract MRSA in recent years, for a total of 60 leaguewide infections.\\n\\nThough Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Omar Gaither rightly points out that \"we\\'re just a naturally dirty sport,\" there are several basic precautions athletes can take to lower the chance of catching an infection. Many athletes shave their ankles, legs, and arms because they don\\'t want athletic tape ripping hair off their bodies, but experts say they should lose the razor. \"No matter how careful the shaving is, you can have nicks and microscopic cuts in the skin,\" says Dr. Daniel Sexton, an infectious disease specialist at the Duke University Medical Center, who consults for an NFL team and several college programs. \"Any time you break that barrier, it becomes a portal through which bacteria can gain access.\" Staph prevention is pretty low-tech. \"You know, this is pretty simple,\" Sexton says. \"Hand washing remains the primary defense against the transmissions of most organisms, including staph. Most people don\\'t think of a locker room as a place where hand hygiene is important, but locker rooms are also mini-emergency rooms.\"\\n\\nIn 2003, a team of researchers tracked the St. Louis Rams and found five players who caught eight MRSA infections. \"We observed a lack of regular access to hand hygiene (i.e., soap and water or alcohol-based hand gels) for trainers who provided wound care,\" they wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. Other offenses included \"skipping of showers by players before the use of communal whirlpools; and sharing or towels \\x97 all factors that might facilitate the transmission of infection in this setting.\"\\n\\nIn short: use a little common sense, tough guys. But when it comes to infectious germs, even a 245-lb. bruiser like Gaither believes you can\\'t always outrun them. \"You can\\'t worry about it to death,\" he says. \"It\\'s not like you can walk around and put gloves on your hand every 10 seconds. Sometimes, there\\'s just not that much you can do.\" Except hope that these recent cases are a coincidental hiccup, and not an epidemic that seriously tackles the NFL.\\n\\n(See pictures of the week here.)\\nWhat was this article about?

It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \"cucchiaio\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack\\'s surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\"Silver spoon\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack\\'s final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.

The word \"video\" in \"video game\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \"literary\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction\\'s freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - For the Robert A. Heinlein short story collection , see Expanded Universe ( Heinlein ) . The term expanded universe ( sometimes called an extended universe ) is generally used to denote the \\' extension \\' of a media franchise ( i.e. a television show , series of featured films , etc. ) with other media ( generally comics and original novels ) . This typically involves new adventures for existing characters already developed within the franchise ; however in some case entirely new characters and complex mythology are developed . This is not the same as an adaptation , which is a retelling of the same story , usually on a different medium . Nearly every media franchise with a committed fan base has some form of expanded universe . A very popular example of this is fan fictions . Fan fictions are stories created by a fan base that portrays existing characters in new and different ways .  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \"literatura\"/\"litteratura\" (derived itself from \"littera\": \"letter\" or \"handwriting\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - A media franchise is a set of related media in which several derivative works have been produced from an original creative work (usually that of fiction), such as a film, a work of literature, a television program or a video game. A media franchise is characterized by its components generally sharing a common fictional universe.   - A fictional universe is a self-consistent imaginary setting with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in novels, comics, films, television shows, video games and other creative works.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation \\'subclass of\\' with the subject \\'expanded universe\\'.

Tom Corbett (Franco Nero) is a prospector who receives a message from a family friend named Carradine (Janos Bathra), telling him to return immediately to the home where he'd lived with his wealthy widowed mother. Years earlier upon her death, she left the house and land to Tom's brother Jeff, and insisted that Tom be sent away. Money was dispatched to him to support him, but her dying wish was that Tom stay away from Laramie Town. Neverless, Tom says goodbye to his foreman, Murray, and rides off.Upon arrival in Laramie Town, Tom finds the house where he grew up in derelict. Pigs and livestock wonder the wreckage where some people also live and work. Tom is told by two rough-looking thugs to leave because the land belongs to a man called Mr. Scott and warned to beware whenever he sees the Scott sign which is a big letter 'S' stamped onto a big letter 'J'.Riding back into town, Tom sees that the Scott sign is all over town, on the bank, the saloon, everywhere, and soon sees why the owners are feared. Jason Scott (John McDouglas), a wealthy businessman rides into the town square with his sadistic son Junior Scott (Nino Castelnuovo) with a posse of thugs surrounding them. The Scotts apprehend a family moving out of the town because of the low wages the Scotts pay them. Junior suddenly kills the elderly couple's teenage son in cold blood and laughs mechanically.Asking around where Jeff Corbett is, Tom is led to an elderly Chinese blacksmith, named Souko (Aysanoa Runachagwa), where Jeff works. Souko directs Tom to the residence of his employee. Tom finds his brother, Jeff, living in a run-down shack on the outskirts of town along with their old Indian housemaid Mercedes (Rina Franchetti).

Jessie goes in first and is told that that she should go see a dermatologist about the skin issues she is having. The doctor then sees Martha who is having a pain in her right arm and who also has hypertension. The doctor talks to Martha about her issues and then heads home for the day.  and a hint : Hypertension , which is also called \"high blood pressure,\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person\\'s systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person\\'s diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \"silent killer.\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication.

Yachts are different from working ships mainly by their leisure purpose.  - A yacht club is a sports club specifically related to yachting.  - Knightsbridge is a residential and retail district in West London, south of Hyde Park. It is identified in the London Plan as one of two international retail centres in London, alongside the West End.  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - The London Plan is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom that is written by the Mayor of London and published by the Greater London Authority. The regional planning document was first published in final form on 10 February 2004. In addition to minor alterations, it was substantially revised and republished in February 2008 and again in July 2011. The London Plan published in July 2011 is currently in effect and has 2031 as a formal end date. minor alterations are being made to the plan to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework and other changes in national policy.  - A yacht is a recreational boat or ship. The term originates from the Dutch word \"jacht\" \"hunt\", and was originally defined as a light fast sailing vessel used by the Dutch navy to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries.

ANC leader Jacob Zuma is expected to be South Africa\\'s next president. South African media reported Thursday that the ANC had won around 65 percent of the vote with one third of ballots counted. Reports suggested the opposition Democratic Alliance could be on course to claim control of Western Cape province -- but the ANC was ahead in the country\\'s eight other provinces. \"This party is an elephant. You cannot actually topple an elephant,\" presidential candidate Jacob Zuma told thousands of supporters at ANC headquarters in central Johannesburg, according to Reuters.com. Zuma, who danced and sang his trademark \"Bring me my machine gun\" anti-apartheid anthem, stressed the ANC was \"not yet celebrating victory.\" Final results are not expected until Saturday. All counting is done by hand in the country, which has 23 million registered voters. Members of parliament will elect the country\\'s president next month. The Independent Electoral Commission said the number of people voting on Wednesday created long lines and a shortage of ballot boxes and papers in some districts and voting stations.  Watch as South Africa waits for a winner ». \"We thank voters for their enthusiasm and patience as they waited to exercise their democratic right to vote,\" commission Chairwoman Brigalia Bam said Wednesday. Although the ANC is widely expected to win, it remains to be seen how much ground the two main opposition parties -- the Democratic Alliance and the Congress of the People -- will gain, and whether the ANC will be able to hold onto its two-thirds parliamentary majority. The ANC has gained votes in every election since 1994, when the country held its first democratic election. But the Congress of the People -- a breakaway faction of the ANC -- threatens the ruling party\\'s grip on power.  Voter shares feelings about ANC and new rival ». The ANC has been dogged by allegations of corruption and has been accused of failing to deliver services to the poor. And Zuma until recently faced fraud and corruption charges. The country\\'s prosecuting authority dropped the charges two weeks before the elections, citing alleged political interference in the case. That decision sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties accusing prosecutors of buckling under political pressure. Twenty-six parties vied in Wednesday\\'s election. They included Islamic and Christian parties, and right-wing Afrikaaner and socialist groups. Learn more about some of South Africa\\'s political parties. More than 5,000 domestic and international observers are monitoring the election, according to the electoral commission.

The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Now, I have a new situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts.

      "One of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\n",
